<br><font size=+2>FUNCTION OF THE CONTROLS</font>
</b></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four controls in the helicopter that the 
pilot must use during flight <a href="chapter_4.html#fig 27">(fig. 27)</a>. 
They are (1) collective pitch control; (2) throttle control; (3) antitorque 
pedals (auxiliary or tail rotor control); and (4) cyclic pitch control.

<p><b><a name="collective">Collective pitch control</a></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collective pitch lever or stick is located by the 
left side of the pilot's seat and is operated with the left hand 
<a href="chapter_4.html#fig 28">(fig. 28)</a>. This lever moves up and down 
pivoting about the aft end and, through a series of mechanical linkages, 
changes the pitch angle of the main rotor blades. As the collective pitch 
lever is raised, there is a simultaneous and equal increase in the pitch 
angle of all the main rotor blades; as the lever is lowered, there is a 
simultaneous and equal decrease in the pitch angle. The amount of movement 
of the lever determines the amount of blade pitch change.

<a name="angle of attack"></a>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the pitch angle of the rotor blades is changed, the 
angle of attack of each blade will also be changed. A change in the angle of 
attack changes the drag on the rotor blades. As the angle of attack 
increases, drag increases and rotor RPM and engine RPM (the needles are 
joined) tend to decrease; as the angle of attack decreases, drag decreases 
and the RPM tends to increase. Since it is essential that the RPM remain 
constant, there must be some means of making a proportionate change in power 
to compensate for the change in drag. This coordination of power change with 
blade pitch angle change is controlled through a collective pitch 
lever-throttle control cam linkage which automatically increases power 
when the collective pitch lever is raised, and decreases power when the 
lever is lowered.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collective pitch control is the primary altitude 
control. Raising the collective pitch lever increases the rotor's lift and, 
through the cam linkage with the throttle, increases engine power. The 
collective pitch control is, there, the primary manifold pressure control 
<a href="chapter_4.html#fig 29">(fig. 29)</a>.

either control results in a change in both manifold pressure and RPM.</font>
</center>

<p><b><a name="throttle">Throttle control</a></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The throttle is mounted on the forward end of the 
collective pitch lever in the form of a motorcycle-type twist grip. The 
function of the throttle is to regulate RPM. If the collective 
pitch-throttle synchronization unit does not automatically maintain a 
constant RPM when a change is made in the collective pitch stick position, 
the throttle may be moved manually with the twist grip to make further 
adjustments of engine RPM. Twisting the throttle outboard increases RPM; 
twisting it inboard decreases RPM <a href="chapter_4.html#fig 30">
(fig. 30)</a>.

<p><b><a name="coordination">Collective pitch-throttle coordination</a></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collective pitch is the primary control for manifold 
pressure; the throttle is the primary control for RPM. Since the collective 
pitch control also influences RPM, and the throttle also influences manifold 
pressure each is considered to be a secondary control of the other's 
functions. Therefore, the pilot must analyze both the tachometer (RPM 
indicator) and manifold pressure gauge to determine which control to use 
and how much. To best illustrate the relationship, a few problems with 
solutions follow:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These problems illustrate how one control change 
accomplishes two purposes. An extension of the reasoning used in the 
solutions will show how various combinations of control inputs can be 
coordinated to achieve any desired RPM-manifold pressure setting. As with 
any other aircraft controls, large adjustments of either collective pitch or 
throttle should be avoided. All corrections should be accomplished through 
the use of smooth pressures.

<p><b><a name="antitorque">Antitorque pedals</a></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thrust produced by the auxiliary (tail) rotor is 
governed by the position of the antitorque pedals. These pedals are located 
as shown in <a href="chapter_4.html#fig 27">figure 27</a>. They are linked 
to a pitch change mechanism in the tail rotor gear box to permit the pilot 
to increase or decrease the pitch of the tail rotor blades. The primary 
purpose of the tail rotor and its controls is to counteract the torque 
effect of the main rotor.

<p><b><a name="heading control">Heading control</a></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tail rotor and its controls not only enable the 
pilot to counteract the torque of the main rotor during flight, but also to 
control the heading of the helicopter during hovering flight, hovering turns 
and hovering patterns. It should be thoroughly understood that in forward 
flight, the pedals are not used to control the heading of the helicopter 
(except during portions of crosswind takeoffs and approaches); rather, they 
are used to compensate for torque to put the helicopter in longitudinal trim 
so that coordinated flight (that is, neither slipping nor skidding) can be 
maintained. The cyclic control is used to change heading by making a 
coordinated turn to the desired direction.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thrust of the tail rotor is dependent upon the 
pitch angle of the tail rotor blades and, to a certain extent, upon the 
main rotor RPM. (For this particular discussion, we will assume that the 
main rotor RPM remains constant.) The pitch angle of the tail rotor blades 
determines the size of the bite of air the blades take as they rotate. The 
tail rotor may have a positive pitch angle, that is, the rotor bites the 
air to the right which tends to pull the tail to the right; or it may have 
a negative pitch angle in which case the rotor bites the air to the left, 
tending to pull the tail to the left; or it may have zero pitch, in which 
case it produces no thrust in either direction.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the right pedal moved forward of the neutral 
position, the tail rotor either has a negative pitch angle or a small 
positive pitch angle--the farther forward the the right pedal is, the 
larger the negative pitch angle; the nearer the right pedal is to the 
neutral position, the more positive the pitch angle the tail rotor will 
have; and somewhere in between, the tail rotor will have a zero pitch 
angle. As the left pedal is moved forward of the neutral position, the 
positive pitch angle of the tail rotor increases until it becomes maximum 
with full forward displacement of the left pedal.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a negative pitch angle, the tail rotor thrust is 
working in the same direction as torque reaction of the main rotor. With a 
small positive pitch angle, the tail rotor does not produce sufficient 
thrust to overcome the torque effect of the main rotor during cruising 
flight. Therefore, if the right pedal is displaced forward of neutral 
during cruising flight, the tail rotor thrust will not overcome the torque 
effect and the nose will yaw to the right <a href="chapter_4.html#fig 31">
(fig. 31, left)</a>.

<br><font size=-1>Figure 31.- Tail rotor pitch angle and thrust in 
relation to pedal positions during cruising flight.</font>
</center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the left pedal in a forward position, the tail 
rotor has a medium positive pitch angle. In medium positive pitch, the tail 
rotor thrust approximately equals the torque of the main rotor during 
cruising flight, so the helicopter will maintain a constant heading in level 
flight <a href="chapter_4.html#fig 31">(fig. 31, middle)</a>.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the left pedal in a forward position, the tail 
rotor is in a high positive pitch position. In a high positive pitch 
position, tail rotor thrust exceeds the thrust needed to overcome torque 
effect during cruising flight so the helicopter nose will yaw to the left 
<a href="chapter_4.html#fig 31">(fig. 31, right)</a>.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above explanation is based on cruising power and 
airspeed. Since the amount of torque is dependent on the amount of engine 
power being supplied to the main rotor, the relative positions of the pedals 
required to counteract torque will depend upon the amount of power being 
used at any time. In general, however, the less power being used, the 
greater the requirement for forward displacement of the right pedal; the 
greater the power being used, the greater the forward displacement of the 
left pedal.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum positive pitch angle of the tail rotor is 
generally somewhat greater than the maximum negative pitch angle available. 
This is because the primary purpose of the tail rotor is to counteract the 
torque of the main rotor. The capability for tail rotors to produce thrust 
to the left (negative pitch angle) is necessary because, during 
autorotation, the drag of the transmission tends to yaw the nose to the 
left--in the same direction that the main rotor is turning.

<p><b><a name="cyclic">Cyclic pitch control</a></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As discussed previously, the total lift-thrust force is 
always perpendicular to the tip-path plane of the main rotor. When the 
tip-path plane is tilted away from the horizontal, the lift-thrust force is 
divided into two components--the horizontal acting force, thrust, and the 
upward acting force, lift (<a href="Chapter_2.html#fig 11">fig, 11</a>). 
<i>The purpose of the cyclic pitch control is to tilt the tip-path plane in 
the direction that horizontal movement is desired.</i> The thrust component 
then pulls the helicopter in the direction of rotor tilt. The cyclic control 
has no effect on the magnitude of the total lift-thrust force, but merely 
changes the direction of this force, thus controlling the attitude and 
airspeed of the helicopter.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rotor disc tilts in the direction that pressure is 
applied to the cyclic. If the cyclic stick is moved forward, the rotor disc 
tilts forward; if the cyclic is moved aft, the rotor disc tilts aft, and so 
on <a href="chapter_4.html#fig 32">(fig. 32)</a>.

<br><font size=-1>Figure 32.- Relationship of cyclic stick position to 
rotor disc position and helicopter movement.</font>
</center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that the rotor disc will always tilt in the 
direction that the cyclic stick is displaced, the mechanical linkage between 
the cyclic stick and the rotor (through the swash plate) must be such that 
the maximum downward deflection of blades is reached in the direction the 
stick is displaced and the maximum upward deflection is reached in the 
opposite direction. Otherwise, the pilot would have a difficult job of 
relating the direction of cyclic stick displacement to the rotor disc tilt. 
This is accomplished through the mechanical linkage which decreases the 
pitch angle of the rotor blades 90&deg; before they reach the direction of 
displacement of the cyclic stick and increases the pitch angle of the rotor 
blades 90&deg; after they pass the direction of displacement of the cyclic 
stick. Any increase in pitch angle increases the angle of attack; any 
decrease in pitch angle decreases the angle of attack.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="gyro precession">For example,</a> as the 
cyclic stick is displaced forward, the angle of attack is decreased as the 
rotor blades pass the 90&deg; position to the pilot's right and is 
increased as the blades pass the 90&deg; position to the pilot's left. 
Because of gyroscopic precession, maximum downward deflection of the rotor 
blades is forward and maximum upward deflection is aft, causing the rotor 
disc to tilt forward in the same direction as cyclic stick displacement. A 
similar analysis could be made for any direction of displacement of the 
cyclic stick.
