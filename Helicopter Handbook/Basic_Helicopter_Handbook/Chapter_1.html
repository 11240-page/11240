<p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless otherwise indicated, this handbook is 
based on a helicopter that has the following characteristics:</i></b>

<blockquote><blockquote><b><i>
1-An unsupercharged reciprocating engine.
<br>2-A single main rotor rotating in counterclockwise direction
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(looking downward on the rotor).
<br>3-An antitorque (tail) rotor.
<br>4-Skid-type landing gear.
</i></b></blockquote></blockquote>

<p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information is intended to be general in nature 
and should apply to most helicopters having these characteristics.</i></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Before launching into a detailed discussion of the various 
forces acting on a helicopter in flight, it is first necessary that 
you understand the meaning of a few basic aerodynamic terms, how 
the force of lift is created, and the effect that certain factors 
have on lift.

<p><b><a name="airfoil">Airfoil</a>.-</b> 
An airfoil is any surface designed to produce lift or thrust when air 
passes over it. Propellers and wings of airplanes are airfoils. Rotor 
blades on helicopters are airfoils. The wing of an airplane is normally an 
unsymmetrical airfoil, that is, the top surface has more curvature than the 
lower surface.

<br><font size=-1>Figure 1.- Symmetrical and unsymmetrical airfoils.</font>
</center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main rotor blades of most helicopters are 
symmetrical airfoils; that is, having the same curvature on both upper and 
lower surfaces <a href="Chapter_1.html#fig 1">(fig. 1)</a>. Much research, 
however, is being conducted in the use of unsymmetrical airfoils for main 
rotor blades, and at least one currently manufactured make of helicopter is 
equipped with main rotor blades that are not considered true symmetrical 
airfoils.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On an unsymmetrical airfoil, the center of 
pressure is variable--as the angle of attack increases, the center 
of pressure moves forward along the airfoil surface; as the angle 
of attack decreases, the center of pressure moves rearward. On a 
symmetrical airfoil, center of pressure movement is very limited. 
A symmetrical airfoil is preferred for rotor blades so that a 
relatively stable center of pressure is maintained. Improvements 
in control systems may allow more latitude in blade designs in 
the future.

<br><font size=-1>Figure 3.- Relationship between the flight path of an 
airfoil and relative wind. Relative wind is parallel and</font> 
<br><font size=-1>in the opposite direction to flight path.</font></center>

<p><b><a name="relative wind">Relative Wind.-</a></b> 
Relative wind is the direction of the 
airflow with respect to an airfoil. If an airfoil moves forward 
horizontally, the relative wind moves backward horizontally 
<a href="Chapter_1.html#fig 3">(fig. 3)</a>. If an airfoil moves backward 
horizontally, the relative wind moves forward horizontally. If an airfoil 
moves forward and upward, the relative wind moves backward and downward. If 
an airfoil moves backward and downward, the relative wind moves 
forward and upward. Thus the flight path and relative wind are 
parallel but travel in opposite directions. (Forward and backward 
as used here are relative to fore and aft axis of the 
helicopter--forward meaning in the direction the nose of the 
helicopter points, and backward meaning the direction the tail points.)

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Relative wind may be affected by several factors 
including the rotation of the rotor blades, horizontal movement 
of the helicopter, flapping of the rotor blades, and wind speed 
and direction.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Relative wind is created by the motion of an airfoil 
through the air, by the motion of air past an airfoil, or by a 
combination of the two. For a helicopter, the relative wind is the 
flow of air with respect to the rotor blades. When the rotor is 
stopped, wind blowing over the blades creates a relative wind; when 
the helicopter is hovering in a no-wind condition, relative wind is 
created by the motion of the rotor blades through the air; when the 
the helicopter is hovering in a wind, the relative wind is a 
combination of the wind and the motion of the rotor blades through 
the air; and when the helicopter is in horizontal flight, the 
relative wind is a combination of the rotation of the rotor blades 
and the movement of the helicopter.

<br>between the chord line and a reference plane determined
<br>by the rotor hub or the plane of rotation.</font></center>

<p><b><a name="pitch angle">Pitch angle.-</a></b> 
The rotor blade pitch angle is the acute 
angle between the blade chord line and a reference plane determined 
by the main rotor hub. Since the rotor plane of rotation is parallel 
to the plane containing the main rotor hub, the rotor blade pitch 
angle could also be described as the acute angle between the blade 
chord line and the rotor plane of rotation <a href="Chapter_1.html#fig 4">
( fig. 4 )</a>. The pitch angle can be varied by the pilot through the use 
of cockpit controls (collective and cyclic pitch controls) provided for 
this purpose.

the relative<br>wind line and the chord line.</font></center>

<p><b><a name="angle of attack">Angle of attack</a>.-</b> 
The angle of attack is the angle between 
the chord line of the airfoil and the direction of the relative wind 
<a href="Chapter_1.html#fig 5">(fig. 5)</a>. The angle of attack should not 
be confused with the pitch angle of the rotor blades. The pitch angle is 
determined by the position of the appropriate cockpit controls (collective 
and cyclic pitch), whereas the angle of attack is determined by the 
direction of the relative wind. The angle of attack may be less than, 
equal to, or greater than the pitch angle as shown in 
<a href="Chapter_1.html#fig 6">figure 6</a>. The pilot 
can increase or decrease the angle of attack by changing the pitch 
angle of the rotor blades. If the pitch angle is increased, the 
angle of attack is increased; if the pitch angle is decreased, the 
angle of attack is decreased. Since the angle of attack is dependent 
on relative wind, the same factors that affect the relative wind also 
affect the angle of attack.

greater than pitch angle 90&deg; to the pilot's left (bottom); 
and equal to<br>pitch angle in the fore (left) and aft (right) 
positions.</font>

<p><b><a name="lift">Lift.-</a></b> 
The force, lift, is derived from an airfoil through 
a principle often referred to as Bernoulli's Principle or the 
&quot;venturi effect.&quot; As air velocity increases through the 
constricted portion of a venturi tube, the pressure decreases. Compare 
the upper surface of an airfoil with the constriction in the venturi tube 
<a href="Chapter_1.html#fig 7">(fig. 7)</a>. They are very similar. The 
upper half of the venturi tube is replaced by layers of undisturbed air. 
Thus, as air flows over the upper surface of an airfoil, the curvature of 
the airfoil causes an increase in the speed of the airflow. The increased 
speed of airflow results in a decrease in pressure on the upper surface of 
the airfoil. At the same time, airflow strikes the lower surface of the 
airfoil at an angle, building up pressure. The combination of decreased 
pressure on the upper surface and the increased pressure on the lower 
surface results in an upward force. This is the force, lift.

<br>an airfoil through a combination of decreased pressure above
<br>the airfoil (as per Bernoulli's Principle.), and increased
<br>pressure beneath.
</font></center>

<p><b><a name="drag">Drag (airfoil).-</a></b> 
At the same time the airfoil is producing 
lift, it also is subject to a drag force. Drag is the term used for 
the force that tends to resist movement of the airfoil through the 
air--the retarding force of inertia and wind resistance. Drag acts 
parallel and in the opposite direction to the movement of the airfoil 
or, if you prefer, in the same direction as the relative wind. This 
force, drag, causes a reduction in rotor RPM (revolutions per minute) 
when the angle of attack is increased. An increase in angle of attack 
then not only produces an increase in lift, but it also produces an 
increase in drag <a href="Chapter_1.html#fig 8">(fig. 8)</a>.

<br>and drag forces. As the angle of attack increases, lift
<br>and drag increases.
</font></center>

<p><b><a name="stall">Stall.-</a></b> 
When the angle of attack increases up to a certain point, the air can no 
longer flow smoothly over the top surface because of the excessive change 
of direction required. This loss of streamlined flow results in a swirling, 
turbulent airflow, and a large increase in drag. The turbulent airflow also 
causes a sudden increase in pressure on the top surface resulting in a 
large loss of lift. At this point, the airfoil is said to be in a stalled 
condition.

<p><b><a name="lift and angle of attack">Lift and angle of attack.-</a></b> 
As the angle of attack of an airfoil increases, the lift increases (up to 
the stall angle) providing the velocity of the airflow (relative wind) 
remains the same <a href="Chapter_1.html#fig 8">(fig. 8)</a>. Since 
the pilot can increase or decrease the angle of attack by increasing 
or decreasing the pitch angle of the rotor blades through the use of the 
collective pitch cockpit control, lift produced by the rotor blades can 
be increased or decreased. The pilot must remember, however, that any 
increase in angle of attack will also increase drag on the rotor blades, 
tending to slow down the rotor rotation. Additional power will be 
required to prevent this slowing down of the rotor.

<p><b><a name="lift and velocity">Lift and velocity of airflow.-</a></b> 
As the velocity of the airflow 
(relative wind) increases, the lift increases for any given angle of 
attack. Since the pilot can increase or decrease the rotor RPM which, 
in turn, increases or decreases the velocity of the airflow, the amount 
of lift can be changed. As a general rule, however, the pilot attempts 
to maintain a constant rotor RPM and changes the lift force by varying 
the angle of attack.

<p><b><a name="lift and air density">Lift and air density</a>.-</b> 
Lift varies directly with the density of the air--as the air density 
increases, lift and drag increase; as air density decreases, lift and drag 
decreases.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What affects air density? Altitude and atmospheric 
changes affect air density. <i>The higher the altitude the less dense 
the air</i>. At 10,000 feet the air is only two-thirds as dense as the 
air at sea level. Therefore, if a helicopter is to maintain its lift, 
the angle of attack of the rotor blades must be increased. To increase 
the angle of attack, the pilot must increase the pitch angle of the 
blades. We have already seen that, as the pitch angle increases, drag 
on the rotor system increases and rotor RPM tends to decrease. 
Therefore, more power must be applied to prevent a decrease in rotor 
RPM. This is why a helicopter requires more power to hover at higher 
altitudes than under the same conditions at lower altitudes. 
(See <a href="Chapter_8.html#fig 52">fig. 52</a> and the accompanying 
discussion.)

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the atmospheric changes in temperature, 
pressure, or humidity, the density of the air may be different, 
even at the same altitude, from one day to the next or from one 
location in the country to another. Because air expands when heated, 
<i>hot air is less dense than cold air</i>. For the helicopter to 
produce the same amount of lift on a hot day as on a cold day, the 
rotor blades must be operated at a higher angle of attack. This 
requires that the blades be operated at a greater pitch angle which 
increases rotor drag and tends to reduce rotor RPM. Therefore, to 
maintain a constant rotor RPM, more throttle is required. For this 
reason, a helicopter requires more power to hover on a hot day than 
on a cold day. (See <a href="Chapter_8.html#fig 53">fig. 53</a> and 
the accompanying discussion.)

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since air expands as pressure decreased, there 
will be fluctuations in the air density due to changes in atmospheric 
pressure. <i>The lower the pressure, the less dense the air</i> and, 
for the same reason stated previously, the greater the power required 
to hover.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="moist air">
Because water vapor weighs less than an equal amount of dry air, 
<i>moist air</i> (high relative humidity) <i>is less dense than dry air</i> 
(low relative humidity).</a> Because of this, 
a helicopter will require more power to hover on a humid day than on 
a dry day (see <a href="Chapter_8.html#fig 54">fig. 54</a> and the 
accompanying discussion). This is especially true on hot, humid days 
because <i>the hotter the day, the greater the amount of water vapor 
the air can hold</i>. The more moisture (water vapor) in the air, the 
less dense the air.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the above discussion, it is obvious that 
<i>a pilot should beware of high, hot, and humid conditions</i>-high 
altitudes, hot temperatures, and high moisture content (see 
<a href="Chapter_8.html#fig 55">fig. 55</a> and the accompanying 
discussion). A pilot should be especially aware of these conditions at the 
destination, since sufficient power may not be available to complete a 
landing safely, particularly when the helicopter is operating at high gross 
weights (see <a href="Chapter_8.html#fig 64">fig. 64</a> and the 
accompanying discussion).

<p><b><a name="lift and weight">Lift and weight.-</a></b> 
The total weight (gross weight) of a helicopter is the first force that 
must be overcome before flight is possible. Lift, the force which overcomes 
or balances the force of weight, is obtained from the rotation of the main 
rotor blades.

<p><b><a name="thrust and drag">Thrust and drag.-</a></b> 
Thrust moves the aircraft in the desired 
direction; drag, the retarding force of inertia and wind resistance, 
tends to hold it back. In vertical flight, drag acts downward; in 
horizontal flight, drag acts horizontally and opposite in direction 
to the thrust component. Thrust, like lift, is obtained from the main 
rotor. Drag, as discussed here, is the drag of the entire 
helicopter--not just the drag of the rotor blades which was discussed 
earlier. The use of the term &quot;drag&quot; in subsequent portions of 
this handbook should be considered as having this same connotation. In 
future references to the drag of the rotor blades, the statement &quot;drag 
of the rotor blades or rotor system&quot; will be used.
