<br><font size=+2>WEIGHT AND BALANCE</font>
</b></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All helicopters are designed for certain limit loads 
and balance conditions. The pilot is responsible for making sure that the 
weight and balance limitations are met before takeoff. Any pilot who takes 
off in a helicopter that is not within the designed load and balance 
condition is not only violating FAA regulations but is inviting disaster.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three kinds of weight must be considered in the 
loading of every helicopter. These are empty weight, useful load, and 
gross weight.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><a name="weight">Empty weight</a></i>.--
The weight of the helicopter 
including the structure, the powerplant, all fixed equipment, all fixed 
ballast, unusable fuel, oil, total quantity of engine coolant, and total 
quantity of hydraulic fluid.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>
<a name="useful load">Useful load (payload)</a></i>.--The weight of the 
pilot, passengers, baggage (including removable ballast and usable fuel).

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>
<a name="gross weight">Gross weight</a></i>.--The empty weight plus the 
useful load.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i><a name="max gross weight">Maximum gross 
weight</a></i>.--The maximum weight for which the helicopter is 
certificated for flight.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although a helicopter is certificated for a specified 
maximum gross weight, it will not be safe off with load under all 
conditions. Conditions that affect takeoff, climb, hovering, and landing 
performance may require the &quot;off loading&quot; of fuel, passengers, or 
baggage to some weight less than maximum allowable. Such conditions would 
include high altitudes, high temperatures, and high humidity, the 
combination of which determines the density altitude at any given place. 
Additional factors to consider are takeoff and landing surfaces, takeoff 
and landing distances available, and the presence of obstacles.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the various adverse conditions that may 
exist, many times the helicopter pilot must decide the needs of the type 
mission to be flown and load the helicopter accordingly. For example, if 
all seats are occupied and maximum baggage is carried, gross weight 
limitations may require that less than maximum fuel be carried. On the 
other hand, if the pilot is interested in range, a full fuel load but fewer 
passengers and less baggage may be decided upon.

<p><b><a name="balance">Balance</a></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only must the pilot consider the gross weight of 
the helicopter, but also must determine that the load is arranged to fall 
within the allowable center-of-gravity range specified in the helicopter 
weight and balance limitations contained in the helicopter flight manual. 
The center of gravity, often referred to as the &quot;CG,&quot; is the point 
at which all the weight of the system is considered to be concentrated. 
If the helicopter were suspended by a sling attached to the  
center-of-gravity point, the helicopter fuselage would remain parallel to  
the surface much as a perfectly balanced teeter-totter (seesaw). The 
allowable range is specified for each helicopter, but it usually extends a 
short distance fore and aft of the main rotor mast. For most types of 
helicopters, the location of the CG must be kept within much narrower limits 
than that in airplanes--less than 3 inches in some cases.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ideal condition is to have the helicopter in such 
perfect balance that the fuselage will remain horizontal in hovering flight, 
with no cyclic pitch control necessary except that which may be made 
necessary by wind. The fuselage acts as a pendulum suspended from the rotor. 
Any change in the center of gravity changes the angle at which it hangs from 
this point of support. If the center of gravity is located directly under 
the rotor mast, the helicopter hangs horizontal; if the center of gravity 
is too far aft of the mast, the helicopter hangs with the nose tilted up; 
and if the center of gravity is too far forward of the mast, the nose 
tilts down <a href="Chapter_7.html#fig 45">(fig. 45)</a>. <i>Out of balance 
loading of the helicopter makes control more difficult and decreases 
maneuverability</i> since cyclic stick effectiveness is restricted in the 
direction opposite to CG location. Because helicopters are relatively 
narrow and high sideward speeds will not be attained, lateral balance 
presents no problems in normal flight instruction and passenger flights, 
although some light helicopter manuals specify the seat from which solo 
flight will be made. However, if external loads are carried in such a 
position that a large lateral displacement of the cyclic stick is required 
to maintain level flight, fore and aft cyclic stick effectiveness will be 
very limited.

<br><font size=-1>Figure 45.- Effect of center of gravity on cyclic stick 
position and helicopter attitude during hovering flight.</font>
</center>

<p><b><a name="forward limit">CG forward of forward limit</a></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This condition may arise in a two-place helicopter when 
a heavy pilot and passenger take off without baggage or proper ballast 
located aft of the rotor mast. The condition will become worse as the flight 
progresses due to fuel consumption, if the main fuel tank is also located 
aft of the rotor mast.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pilot will recognize this condition after coming 
to a hover following following a vertical takeoff. The helicopter will have 
a nose-low attitude and an excessive rearward displacement of the cyclic 
stick will be required to maintain a hover in a no-wind condition, if 
hovering flight can be maintained at all <a href="Chapter_7.html#fig 45">
(fig. 45)</a>. Flight under this condition <i>should not be continued</i> 
since the possibility of running out of rearward cyclic control will 
increase rapidly as fuel is consumed, and the pilot may find it impossible 
to decelerate sufficiently to bring the helicopter to a stop. Also, in case 
of engine failure and the resulting autorotation, sufficient cyclic control 
may not be available to flare properly for the landing.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hovering into a strong wind will make this condition 
less easily recognizable since less rearward displacement of the cyclic 
control will be required than when hovering in a no-wind condition. 
Therefore, in determining if a critical balance condition in this situation 
exists, the pilot should consider the wind velocity and its relation to 
rearward displacement of the cyclic stick.

<p><b><a name="aft limit">CG aft of aft limit</a></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without proper ballast in the cockpit, this condition 
may arise when (1) a lightweight pilot takes off solo with a full load of 
fuel loaded aft of the rotor mast, (2) a lightweight pilot takes off with 
maximum baggage allowed in a baggage compartment located aft of the rotor 
mast, or (3) a lightweight pilot takes off with a combination of baggage and 
substantial fuel where both are aft of the rotor mast.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pilot will recognize this condition after coming 
to a hover following a vertical takeoff. The helicopter will have a tail-low 
attitude and an excessive forward displacement of the cyclic stick will be 
required to maintain a hover in a no-wind condition, if a hover can be 
maintained at all. If there is a wind, an even greater forward displacement 
will be required.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If flight is continued in this condition, the pilot 
may find it impossible to fly in the upper allowable airspeed range due to 
insufficient forward cyclic displacement to maintain a nose-low 
attitude. This particular condition may become quite dangerous if gusty 
or rough air accelerates the helicopter to a higher airspeed than forward 
cyclic control will allow. The nose will start to rise and full forward 
cyclic stick may not be sufficient to hold it down or to lower it once 
it rises.

<p><a name="wandb"><b>Weight and balance information</b></a>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a helicopter is delivered from the factory, the 
empty weight, empty weight CG, and useful load for each particular 
helicopter are noted on a weight and balance data sheet included in the 
helicopter flight manual. These quantities will vary for different 
helicopters of a given series depending upon changes or variations in the 
fixed equipment included in each helicopter when delivered.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, after delivery, additional fixed equipment is 
added, or if some is removed, or a major repair or alteration is made 
which may affect the empty weight, empty weight CG, or useful load, the 
weight and balance data must be revised to reflect these new values. All 
weight and balance changes will be entered in the appropriate aircraft 
record. This generally will be the aircraft logbook. The <i>latest</i> 
weight and balance data should be used in computing all loading problems.

<p><b><a name="sample cg">Sample weight and balance problems</a></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In loading a helicopter for flight the problem is 
two-fold:

<blockquote>
* Is the gross weight within the maximum allowable gross weight?<br>
* Does the helicopter meet balance requirements, i.e., is the CG<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;within the allowable CG range?
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer the first question, merely add the weight 
of the items comprising the useful load (pilot, passengers, fuel, and 
baggage) to the empty weight of the helicopter. (Obtain the latest empty 
weight information from the appropriate aircraft record.) Then check the 
total weight obtained to see that it does not exceed maximum allowable 
gross weight.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer the second question, use the loading chart 
or loading table in the helicopter flight manual for the particular 
helicopter that is being flown.

<p><i>Sample problem 1</i>.--Determine if the gross weight and center of 
gravity are within allowable limits under the following loading conditions 
for a helicopter based on the loading chart in figure 
<a href="Chapter_7.html#fig 46">46</a>.

</table></center>

<p><b>Solution:</b> To use the loading chart for the helicopter in this 
example, the items comprising the useful load must be added to the empty 
weight in a certain order. The maximum allowable gross weight is 1,600 
pounds.

<center><table>
<tr><td></td><td></td><td>Pounds</td></tr>
<tr><td>Empty weight</td><td>____________________</td>

</table></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total weight of the helicopter does not exceed the 
maximum allowable gross weight. By following the sequence of steps (locating 
points A, B, and C) on the loading chart, it is found that the CG is within 
allowable limits <a href="Chapter_7.html#fig 46">(fig. 46)</a>.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the total weight of the helicopter is well 
below the maximum allowable gross weight, the CG falls outside the aft 
allowable limit as defined by the loading chart 
<a href="Chapter_7.html#fig 46">(fig. 46)</a>.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This example illustrates the importance of 
reevaluating the balance problem in a helicopter whenever a change is 
made in the loading. In most airplanes, the discharging of a passenger 
would have little effect on the CG. Because of this fact, the airplane 
pilot may not be aware of the critical loading problems that must 
constantly be kept in mind as a helicopter pilot. If the pilot in this 
example takes off again after discharging the passenger, there will be 
insufficient forward cyclic stick control to hover in a strong wind; it 
may be impossible to fly in the upper airspeed range due to insufficient 
forward cyclic control to maintain a nose-low attitude; and a dangerous 
situation will exist if gusty or rough air accelerates the helicopter to 
a higher airspeed than forward cyclic control will allow.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just the opposite situation from that illustrated by 
sample problems 1 and 2 could exist if a very heavy pilot proceed solo on 
a flight until a substantial amount of fuel was used, then stopped to pick 
up a very heavy passenger and proceeded on the flight without refueling. 
During the solo portion of the flight, the helicopter CG would be within 
allowable limits. During the second portion of the flight with the 
passenger, the CG would be forward of allowable limits. If this pilot did 
take off with the passenger in this example, insufficient aft cyclic control 
would be available to slow the helicopter to a hover and, in case of an 
autorotative landing, insufficient aft cyclic control would be available to 
flare for a landing.

<p><b><a name="without chart">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Determining the CG without 
the use of a loading chart or table</a></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An alternate method of computing center of gravity 
is to use the arm-weight-moment computation method. To use this method, 
we must know the empty weight and empty weight CG (obtained from the 
appropriate aircraft record) and weight and distance from the datum 
line of each portion of the useful load--pilot and passengers, usable 
fuel, and baggage. The following formulas will be used:

<br><br><table>
<tr><td width=10%></td><td>Weight X arm</td><td>= Moment</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>Moment + moment</td><td>= Total Moment</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>Total moment<br>--------------<br>Total weight</td>
<td>= CG</td></tr>
</table><br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some manufacturers chose the datum line at or ahead of 
the most forward structural point on the helicopter, in which case all 
moments are positive. Other manufacturers chose the datum line at some 
point in the middle of the helicopter in which case moments produced by 
weight ahead of the datum line are negative, and moments produced by 
weight aft of the datum line are positive. A sample problem will be 
shown for each type.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If external loads are carried, this is the method 
by which the center of gravity will normally be computed.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the approved center-of-gravity limits are 
station 95 (95 inches from datum line) and station 100, and the maximum 
allowable gross weight is 1,600 pounds, the helicopter meets the weight 
and balance requirements for flight.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figures 48 and 49 show how the charts in the 
helicopter flight manual would normally be used to compute the CG in 
this helicopter. To compute the the CG from these charts, the first 
step is to determine the total weight of total weight of the helicopter 
(in pounds) and total moment (in thousands of inch-pounds).

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The empty weight and empty weight CG are obtained 
from the latest weight and balance information in the helicopter flight 
manual. In this case 1,040 pounds and 101.4.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The total moments for the fuel load and seat load 
are found from the loading chart <a href="Chapter_7.html#fig 48">
(fig. 48)</a>. Locate the diagonal line indicating fuel quantities and 
stations. Draw a horizontal line from the 25-gallon mark to the left side 
of the chart the moment is read to be 16.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Locate the point representing the seat load along 
the bottom of the chart. From this point, draw a vertical line until it 
intersects the diagonal line marked &quot;Pilot and Passenger.&quot; From 
this point of intersection, draw a horizontal line to the left side of the 
chart where the moment is read as 27.7. Tabulating these results and 
totaling, we have the following:

represented by the total weight and total moment just computed. This point 
falls within the center-of-gravity envelope; therefore, the helicopter is 
loaded within center-of-gravity and weight limits.
