<br>AND RIDGELINE OPERATIONS</font>
</b></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A confined area is an area where the flight of the 
helicopter is limited in some direction by terrain or the presence of 
obstructions, natural or manmade. for example, a clearing in the woods, 
a city street, a road, a building roof, and so on, can each be regarded 
as a confined area.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a name="turbulence">Barriers</a> on the surface and the surface itself may 
interfere with the smooth flow of air, resulting in turbulence. This 
interference is transmitted to upper air levels as larger but less 
intense disturbances. Therefore, the greatest turbulence is usually 
found at low altitudes. Gusts are unpredictable variations in wind 
velocity. Ordinary gusts are dangerous only in slow flight at very low 
altitudes. The pilot may be unaware of the gust, and its cessation may 
reduce airspeed below that required to sustain flight due to the loss 
in effective translational lift. Gusts cannot be planned for or 
anticipated. Turbulence, however, can generally be predicted. Turbulence 
will be found in the following areas when the wind velocity exceeds 
10 MPH <a href="Chapter_12.html#fig 81">(fig. 81)</a>:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1--Near the ground of the downwind side of trees, 
buildings, hills, or other obstructions. The turbulent area is always 
relative in size to that of the obstacle, and relative in intensity to 
the velocity of the wind.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2--Near the surface on the immediate upwind side 
of any solid barrier such as trees in leaf, and buildings. This condition 
is not generally dangerous unless the wind velocity is approximately 
20 MPH or higher. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3--In the air, above and slightly downwind of any 
sizable obstruction, such as a hill or mountain range. The size of the 
obstruction and the wind velocity govern the severity and height to which 
the turbulence extends.

<font size=+1>GENERAL RULES FOR CONFINED AREA OPERATIONS</font></center>
	

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some general rules can be stated that apply to 
helicopter operations in any type of confined area. The following are 
some of the more important ones to consider regardless of weather such 
areas are enclosed, or are slopes or pinnacles.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Know the direction and approximate speed of the 
wind at all times, and plan landings and takeoffs with these wind 
conditions in mind. This does not necessarily mean that takeoffs and 
landings will always be made into the wind, but wind must be considered, 
and many times its velocity will determine proper avenues of approach 
and takeoff.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. If possible, plan a flightpath over areas 
suitable for forced landings in case of engine failure. It may be 
necessary to choose between an approach which is crosswind but over 
an open area and one directly into the wind but over heavily wooded 
or extremely rough terrain where a safe forced landing would be 
impossible. Perhaps the initial phase of the approach can be made 
crosswind over the open area and then a turn made into the wind for 
the final portion of the approach.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Always operate the helicopter as closely to its 
normal capabilities as possible considering the situation at hand. In 
all confined area operations, with the exception of the pinnacle operation, 
the angle of descent should be no steeper than necessary to clear any 
barrier in the avenue of approach and still land on the selected spot. 
The angle of climb, on takeoff, should be normal, or not steeper than 
necessary to clear any barrier. Clearing a barrier by a few feet and 
maintaining normal operating RPM, with perhaps a reserve of power, is 
better than clearing a barrier by a wide margin but with a dangerously 
low RPM and no power reserve.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Always make the landing to a specific point and 
not to some general area. This point should be located well forward-away 
from the approach end of the area. The more confined the area, the more 
essential it is that the helicopter be landed precisely at a definite 
point. This point must be kept in sight during the entire final approach. 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Any large increase in elevation between the point 
of takeoff and the point of intended landing must be given due 
consideration, as sufficient power must be available to bring the 
helicopter to a hover at the point of the intended landing. A decrease 
in wind should also be allowed for because of the presence of obstructions.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. When flying a helicopter near obstructions, 
always consider the tail rotor. A safe angle of descent over barriers 
must be established to ensure tail rotor clearance of all obstructions. 
After coming to a hover, care must be taken to avoid turning the tail 
into obstructions.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. If possible, a normal takeoff from a hover should 
be made when departing a confined area. However, if barriers of sufficient 
height exist that would make this impossible, then a maximum performance 
takeoff should be made.

<a name="pinnacle">PINNACLE AND RIDGELINE OPERATIONS</a>
</font></center>
		

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pinnacle is an area from which the surface drops 
away steeply on all sides. A ridgeline is a long area from which the 
surface drops away steeply on one or two sides, such as a bluff or 
precipice. Barriers are not usually present on pinnacles or ridgelines; 
but, if they are, a combination of pinnacle and confined area operations 
may be necessary when operating into and out of such areas. That is, an 
area may require a pinnacle-type operation during the approach and 
landing, but if the strength of the wind dictates the takeoff path 
and barriers exist under that path, a confined area-type takeoff may 
be required when departing that area. Conversely, conditions and 
terrain may justify a confined area-type approach into an area and a 
pinnacle-type departure from that area.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The absence of barriers does not necessarily lessen 
the difficulty of pinnacle or ridgeline operations. Updrafts, downdrafts, 
and turbulence, together with unsuitable terrain in which to make a forced 
landing, may still present extreme hazards.

<p><b>General rules for pinnacle and ridgeline operations</b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following are some of the more important rules 
to consider when conducting pinnacle or ridgeline operations:

<p>1. If necessary to climb to a pinnacle or ridgeline, the climb should 
be performed on the upwind side, when practicable, to take advantage of 
any updrafts.

<br>2. Load, altitude, wind conditions, and terrain features determine
the angle to use in the final part of an approach. A steeper-than-normal
approach may be used when barriers or excessive downdrafts exist. A 
shallower-than-normal approach may be used when there are no barriers or 
downdrafts and when it is suspected that the helicopter cannot be hovered 
out of ground effect. In this case, an approach to the surface may be 
necessary.

<br>3. The approach path to a ridgeline is usually parallel to that 
ridgeline and as nearly into the wind as possible. If a crosswind exists, 
remain clear of downdrafts on the leeward or downwind side of the 
ridgeline. If the wind velocity makes the crosswind landing hazardous, a 
low coordinated turn into the wind may be made just prior to terminating 
the approach.

<br>4. When making an approach to a pinnacle, avoid leeward turbulence and 
keep the helicopter within reach of a forced landing area as long as 
possible.

<br>5. Since pinnacles and ridgelines are generally higher than the 
immediate surrounding terrain, gaining airspeed on the takeoff is more 
important than gaining altitude. The airspeed gained will cause a more 
rapid departure from the area. In addition to covering unfavorable terrain 
rapidly, a higher airspeed affords a more favorable glide angle and thus 
contributes to the chances of reaching a safe area in the event of a 
forced landing. If no suitable area is available, a higher airspeed will 
permit a more effective flare prior to making an autorotative landing.

<a name="high reconnaissance">HIGH RECONNAISSANCE</a>
</font></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary purpose of the high reconnaissance is 
to determine the suitability of an area for a landing. In a high 
reconnaissance, the following items should be accomplished:
<blockquote>
   1--Determine wind direction and speed.<br>
   2--Select the most suitable flightpaths into and out of the area, with 
particular consideration being given forced landing areas.<br>
   3--Plan the approach and select a point for touchdown.<br>
   4--Locate and determine the size of barriers, if any, immediately 
around the area.
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A high reconnaissance is flown at approximately 500 
feet above the surface; however, a higher altitude may be required in 
some helicopters. A general rule to follow is to ensure that sufficient 
altitude is available at all times to land into the wind in case of engine 
failure. This means the greatest altitude will be required when headed 
downwind. A 45&deg; angle of observation will generally allow the best 
estimate of the height of barriers, the presence of obstacles, the size 
of the area, and the slope of the terrain. Safe altitudes and airspeeds 
should be kept within reach whenever possible.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approach path should be generally into the wind 
and over terrain that minimizes the time that the helicopter is not in 
reach of a forced landing area. If by flying at an angle to the wind, a 
forced landing area can be kept in reach, then do so. Having a forced 
landing area available is more important than to fly directly into the 
wind, especially if the wind is not too strong. The decision should be 
made as to the type of approach that will be made. If at all possible, 
a normal approach should be made; however, if there are high barriers, 
a steeper approach will be required.

<center><p><font size=+1>
<a name="low reconnaissance">LOW RECONNAISSANCE</a>
</font></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the low reconnaissance, verify what was seen in 
the high reconnaissance and check for anything new that may have been 
missed. Check especially for wires, slopes, and small crevices because 
these are especially difficult to see from a higher altitude.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A low reconnaissance begins shortly after entry to 
the approach and ends at touchdown. During this time, objects on the 
surface can be better identified and the height of barriers, if any, 
better estimated. The view of the approach path is greatly improved. 
The approach should be as close to a normal approach as possible. If 
new information warrants a change in flightpath or angle of descent, 
it should be made; however, if a major change in angle of descent is 
required, a go-round should be made. If a decision to go around is made, 
it should be done prior to losing effective translational lift.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a decision is made to complete the approach, the 
termination should normally be to a hover so the landing point can be 
carefully checked before the landing is made. Under certain conditions, 
however, it may be desirable to terminate the approach to the surface. 
Whether terminating at a hover or on the surface, once the helicopter is 
on the surface, operating RPM should be maintained until the stability of 
the helicopter is checked to be of a secure and safe position.

<center><p><font size=+1>
<a name="ground reconnaissance">GROUND RECONNAISSANCE</a>
</font></center>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before takeoff, a ground reconnaissance is made to 
determine the type takeoff to be performed, to determine the point from 
which the takeoff should be initiated to ensure the maximum amount of 
available area and, finally, how to best get the helicopter from the 
landing point to the proposed takeoff position.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing to check is the wind. If the engine 
is running, walk a sufficient distance from the helicopter to ensure that 
the downwash of the blades does not interfere. Dust or grass may be 
dropped and the direction observed in which they are blown.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step is to go to the downwind end of the 
available area and mark a position for takeoff so that the tail and main 
rotors will have sufficient clearance from obstructions, if any, behind 
the helicopter. A sturdy marker such as a heavy stone or log should be 
used so it will not blow away.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If wind conditions and available area permit, the 
helicopter should be brought to a hover, turned around, and hovered 
forward from the landing position to takeoff position. Under certain 
conditions, sideward flight to the takeoff position may be necessary. 
If rearward flight is required to reach the takeoff position, reference 
markers should be placed in front of the helicopter in such a way that 
a ground track can be safely followed to the takeoff position and so 
the pilot can see the marker for the takeoff position without going 
beyond it.
