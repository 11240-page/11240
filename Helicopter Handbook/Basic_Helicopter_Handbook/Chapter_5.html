<br><font size=+2>OTHER HELICOPTER COMPONENTS<br>AND THEIR FUNCTIONS</font>
</b></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the preceding Chapter, the control system and its 
functions were discussed in detail. In this Chapter, some of the other 
components and their functions will be discussed briefly to give the 
readers some familiarity with the aircraft they will be flying.

<p><font size="+2"><center><b>
<a name="transmission">TRANSMISSION SYSTEM</a>
</b></center></font>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transmission system transmits engine power to the 
main rotor, tail rotor, generator, and other accessories.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The engine of a helicopter must operate at a 
relatively high speed while the main rotor turns at a much lower speed. This 
speed reduction is accomplished through reduction gears in the transmission 
system and is generally somewhere between 6 to 1 and 9 to 1 (that is, 
between 6 and 9 engine RPM's to 1 main rotor RPM). In a helicopter with a 6 
to 1 ratio, if the engine turns at 2700 RPM, the main rotor turns at 450 
RPM. With a 9 to 1 ratio, if the engine turns at 2700 RPM, the main rotor 
turns at 300 RPM. When the rotor tachometer needle and the engine tachometer 
are super imposed over each other (<a href="Chapter_4.html#fig 29">fig. 29
</a>), the ratio of the engine RPM to the rotor RPM is the same as the gear 
reduction ratio.

<p><font size="+2"><center><b><a name="clutch">CLUTCH</a></b></center></font>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the conventional airplane, it is standard practice 
to have the engine and the propeller permanently connected. The propeller 
serves as a flywheel; there is no reason for the propeller to be at a 
standstill when the engine is running. In the helicopter, there is a 
different relation between the engine and rotor.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of much greater weight of a helicopter rotor 
in relation to the power of the engine than the weight of a propeller in 
relation to the power of the engine in an airplane, it is necessary to have 
the rotor disconnected from the engine to relieve the starter load. For this 
reason, it is necessary to have a clutch between the engine and rotor. The 
clutch allows the engine to be started and gradually assume the load of 
driving the heavy rotor system.

<font size="-1"><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><b>
	The clutch does not provide disengagement of the<br>
	engine from the rotor system for autorotation.<br>
	This is provided through another device.
</b></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></font>

<b><a name="centrifugal">Centrifugal clutch</a></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this type of clutch, contact between the inner and 
outer parts of the clutch is made by the spring-loaded clutch shoes. The 
inner portion of the clutch, the clutch shoes, is rotated by the engine; 
the outer portion of the clutch, the clutch drum, is connected to the main 
rotor through the transmission. At low engine speeds, the clutch shoes are 
held out of contact with the clutch drum by the springs. As engine speed 
increases, centrifugal force throws the clutch shoes outward until they 
contact the clutch drum and motion is transmitted from the engine drive 
shaft to the input drive shaft of the transmission. The rotor starts to 
turn, slowly at first, but with increasing speed as the friction between the 
clutch shoes and drum increases. Slippage of the clutch will be experienced 
until this friction develops sufficiently to drive the drum at engine RPM. 
As the clutch becomes fully engaged, the rotor system will be driven at 
the equivalent of engine RPM and the rotor tachometer needle and engine 
tachometer needle will join or &quot;marry,&quot; that is, one needle will 
be superimposed over the other.

<font size="-1"><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><b>
	The rotor RPM equivalent to the engine RPM depends<br>
	upon the gear reduction ratio between the engine<br>
	and rotor system for the particular helicopter.<br>
	(See Transmission System.)
</b></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></center></font>

<p><b><a name="friction">Friction or belt drive system clutch</a></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This type of clutch is manually engaged by the pilot 
through a lever in the cockpit. Power from the engine drive shaft is 
transmitted to the transmission drive shaft by a series of friction discs 
or belts. With this type of clutch, it is possible to start the engine and 
warm it up without engaging the rotor.

<p><font size="+2"><center><b>
<a name="freewheeling unit">FREEWHEELING UNIT</a>
</b></center></font>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The freewheeling coupling provides for autorotative 
capabilities by automatically disconnecting the rotor system from the engine 
when the engine stops or slows below the equivalent of rotor RPM. When the 
engine is disconnected from the rotor system through the automatic action of 
the freewheeling coupling, the transmission continues to rotate with the 
main rotor thereby enabling the tail rotor to continue turning at its normal 
rate. This permits the pilot to maintain directional control during 
autorotation.

<p><font size="+2"><center><b>
<a name="swash plate">SWASH PLATE ASSEMBLY</a>
</b></center></font>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swash plate consists of two primary elements
through which the rotor mast passes (figs. <a href="Chapter_5.html#fig 34">
34</a>, <a href="Chapter_5.html#fig 36">36</a>, and 
<a href="Chapter_5.html#fig 37">37</a>). One element is a disc, linked to 
the cyclic pitch control. This disc is capable of tilting in any direction 
but does not rotate as the rotor rotates. This nonrotating disc, often 
referred to as the &quot;stationary star,&quot; is attached by a bearing 
surface to a second disc, often referred to as the 
&quot;rotating star,&quot; which turns with the rotor and is mechanically 
linked to the rotor blade pitch horns.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rotor blade pitch horns are placed approximately 
90&deg; ahead of or behind the blade on which they control the pitch change 
(figs, <a href="Chapter_5.html#fig 34">34</a> and 
<a href="Chapter_5.html#fig 37">37</a>). If this were not done, gyroscopic 
precession would cause the movements of the helicopter to be 90&deg; out of 
phase with the movement of the cyclic pitch stick, that is, if the cyclic 
stick were displaced to the right, the helicopter would move forward; if the 
cyclic stick were displaced forward, the helicopter would move to the left, 
and so on.

</center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The illustration in figure 
<a href="Chapter_5.html#fig 33">33</a> shows the pitch horns 90&deg; ahead 
of the blade in the plane of rotation. Figure 
<a href="Chapter_5.html#fig 37">37</a> shows them 90&deg; behind. whether 
they are ahead of or behind the blade will depend on the mechanical linkage 
arrangement between the cyclic stick, swash plate, and pitch horns. It might 
help to understand the relationship between cyclic stick movement and blade 
pitch change if the relationship between cyclic stick movement and the rotor 
blade pitch horn is understood. If the pitch horn is 90&deg; ahead of the 
blade, blade pitch decrease takes place as the pitch horn passes the 
direction in which the cyclic stick is displaced. Blade pitch increase takes 
place as the pitch horn passes the direction opposite to the displacement. 
If the pitch horn is 90&deg; behind the blade, blade pitch decrease takes 
place as the pitch horn passes the direction opposite to the displacement of 
the cyclic stick. Blade pitch increase takes place as the pitch horn passes 
the direction of displacement. In either case, however, blade pitch decrease 
takes place 90&deg; ahead of cyclic stick position and blade pitch increase 
takes place 90&deg; after passing cyclic stick position. Thus, maximum 
downward deflection of the rotor blades occurs in the same direction as 
cyclic stick displacement, and maximum upward deflection occurs in the 
opposite direction.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an example, when the cyclic stick is displaced 
forward, the swash plate nonrotating disc tilts forward and the swash plate 
rotating disc follows this forward tilt <a href="Chapter_5.html#fig 35">
(fig. 35)</a>. Since the mechanical linkage from the rotating disc to the 
rotor blade pitch horns is 90&deg; ahead of or behind the cyclic pitch 
change, the pitch angle is decreased as the rotor blades pass 90&deg; to 
the pilot's right and increased as the rotor blades pass 90&deg; to the 
pilot's left. Because of gyroscopic precession, maximum blade defection 
occurs 90&deg; later in the cycle of rotation. Thus, maximum downward 
deflection of the rotor blades is forward (same direction as cyclic stick 
displacement) and maximum upward deflection is aft, causing the rotor disc 
to tilt forward in the same direction as cyclic stick displacement.

<a name="main rotor">MAIN ROTOR SYSTEM</a>
</b></center></font>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three fundamental types of main rotor 
systems: fully articulated rotors, semirigid rotors, and rigid rotors.

<p><b><a name="fully articulated">Fully articulated rotor systems</a></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fully articulated rotor systems generally consist of 
three or more rotor blades. In a fully articulated rotor system, each rotor 
blade is attached to the rotor hub by a horizontal hinge, called the 
flapping hinge, which permits the blades to flap up and down. Each blade can 
move up and down independently of the others. The flapping hinge may be 
located at varying distances from the rotor hub, and there may be more than 
one. The position is chosen by each manufacturer, primarily with regard to 
stability and control.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each rotor blade is also attached to the hub by a 
vertical hinge, called a drag or lag hinge, that permits each blade, 
independently of the others, to move back and forth in the plane of the 
rotor disc. This movement is called dragging, lead-lag, or hunting. The 
location of this hinge is chosen primarily with regard to controlling 
vibration. Dampers are normally incorporated in design of this type rotor 
system to prevent excessive motion about the drag hinge. The purpose of the 
drag hinge and dampers is to absorb the acceleration and deceleration of the 
rotor blades caused by coriolis effect. Figure 
<a href="Chapter_5.html#fig 37">37</a> points out the flapping hinges and 
drag hinges.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="feather">The</a> blades of a fully 
articulated rotor can also be feathered, that is, rotated about their 
spanwise axis. To put it more simply, feathering means the automatic and 
periodic changing of the pitch angle of the rotor blades.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summarizing then, each blade of a fully articulated 
rotor system can flap, drag, and feather independently of the other blades.

<p><b><a name="semirigid">Semirigid rotor systems</a></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a semirigid rotor system, the rotor blades are 
rigidly interconnected to the hub, but the hub is free to tilt and rock with 
respect to the rotor shaft. In this system, only two-bladed rotors are used. 
The rotor flaps as a unit, that is, as one blade flaps up, the other blade 
flaps down an equal amount.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hinge which permits the flapping or see-saw effect 
is called a teetering hinge (<a href="Chapter_5.html#fig 38">fig. 38</a>). 
The rocking hinge is perpendicular to the teetering hinge and parallel to 
the rotor blades. This hinge allows the head to rock in response to tilting 
of the swash plate by cyclic pitch control, thus changing the pitch angle an 
equal amount on each blade--decreasing it on one and increasing it on the 
other.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rotor blades of a semirigid rotor system may or 
may not require drag hinges depending on whether the system is 
&quot;underslung.&quot; In an underslung system, the rotor blades lie in a 
plane below the plane containing the rotor hub pivot point. Because of 
coning, normal rotor operating RPM will place the center of mass of the 
rotor blades in approximately the same plane as the rotor hub pivot point. 
Consequently, the distance of the center of mass from the axis of rotation 
varies very little. Drag hinges are not needed since the hunting action can 
be absorbed through blade bending and the movement of the gimbal in the 
underslung system.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collective pitch control changes the pitch of each 
blade simultaneously and an equal amount, either increasing the pitch of 
both or decreasing the pitch of both.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summarizing, a semirigid rotor system can flap and 
feather as a unit.

<p><b><a name="rigid">Rigid rotor systems</a></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a rigid rotor system the blades, hub, and mast are 
rigid with respect to each other. In this system, the blades cannot flap or 
drag but can be feathered.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extensive research is being done in this area and, at 
the time of this writing, two makes of rigid rotor helicopters have received 
FAA certification.
