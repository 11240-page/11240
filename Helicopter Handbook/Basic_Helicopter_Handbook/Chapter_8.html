<br><font size=+2>HELICOPTER PERFORMANCE</font>
</b></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="factors">Assuming that a helicopter engine and 
all components are operating satisfactorily, the performance of the 
helicopter is dependent on three major factors:</a>
<blockquote>
<ul><li>Density altitude (air density)<br></li>
<li>Gross weight<br></li>
<li>Wind velocity during takeoff, hovering, and landing</li></ul>
</blockquote>

<p><b><a name="air density">Air density</a></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air, like liquids and other gases, is a fluid. Because 
it is a fluid, it flows and changes shape under pressure. Air is said to 
be &quot;thin&quot; at high altitudes; that is, there are fewer molecules 
per cubic foot of air at 10,000 feet than at sea level. The air at sea level 
is &quot;thin&quot; when compared to air compressed to 30 pounds of pressure 
in an automobile tire. A cubic inch of air compressed in an automobile tire 
is <i>denser</i> than a cubic inch of &quot;free&quot; air at sea level.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in a stack of blankets, the bottom 
blanket is under pressure of all blankets above it. As a result of this 
pressure, the bottom blanket may be squeezed down until it is only one-tenth 
as bulky as the fluffy blanket on top. There is still just as much wool in 
the bottom blanket as there is in the one on top, but the wool in the bottom 
blanket is 10 times more dense. If the second blanket from the bottom of the 
stack were removed, a force of 15 pounds might be required to pull it out. 
The second blanket from the top may require only 1 pound of force. In the 
same way, air layers near the earth's surface have much greater density than 
air layers at higher altitudes. The lower the elevation of the earth's 
surface, the greater the density of the air layers. For example, the layer 
of air at sea level would be denser than the layer of air at the earth's 
surface at Denver, Colo., at approximately 1 mile above sea level.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above principle may be applied in flying aircraft. 
At lower levels the rotor blade is cutting through <i>more</i> and <i>denser 
</i> air, which offers more support (lift) and increases air resistance. The 
same amount of power, applied at higher altitudes where the air is <i> 
thinner</i> and less <i>dense</i>, propel the helicopter faster.

<p><b><a name="density altitude">Density altitude</a></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Density altitude refers to a theoretical air density 
which exists under standard conditions of a given altitude. Standard 
conditions at sea level are:
<blockquote>
	Atmospheric pressure - 29.92 in. of Hg (inches of mercury)<br>

	Temperature - 59&deg; F. (15&deg; C.)
</blockquote>
Standard conditions at any higher altitude are based on:
<blockquote>
	Atmospheric pressure (reduced to sea level) - 29.92 in. of Hg<br>

	Temperature - 59&deg; F. (15&deg; C.) minus 3&frac12;&deg; F.
		(2&deg; C.) per 1,000 feet elevation
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if the atmospheric pressure (reduced to 
sea level) at an airport located 5,000 feet above sea level is 29.92 inches 
of mercury and the temperature is 59&deg;-(3.5&deg; X 5) = 41.5&deg; F. 
(5&deg; C.), the air density is standard at that altitude. (The actual 
barometric pressure at an elevation of 5,000 feet under these conditions 
would be approximately 24.92 inches of mercury since atmospheric pressure 
decreases approximately 1 inch per 1,000 - foot increase in altitude. The 
average temperature decrease per 1,000 - foot increase in altitude is 
3.5&deg; F.).

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure <a href="Chapter_8.html#fig 51">51</a> shows a 
density altitude chart. If we locate the +5&deg; vertical line along the 
bottom of the chart, follow this line up to its intersection with the 
5,000-foot diagonal line, then follow the horizontal line to the left side 
of the chart, we read a density altitude of 5,000 feet.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four factors which affect density altitude are 
altitude, atmospheric pressure, temperature, and moisture content of the 
air.

<p><b>Altitude</b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already seen the effects of altitude on air 
density in the first section of this chapter. The greater the elevation of 
an airport or landing area, the less the atmospheric pressure and, 
consequently, the less dense the air. The less dense the air, the greater 
the density altitude. What is the result when operating at a high density 
altitude? Helicopter performance is decreased 
<a href="Chapter_8.html#fig 52">(fig, 52)</a>. It can be seen from 
the density altitude chart that, as altitude increases, density altitude 
increases.

<p><b><a name="atmospheric pressure">Atmospheric pressure</a></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmospheric pressure at an airport or landing 
area at a given elevation can change from day to day - sometimes a very 
noticeable amount which, when combined with other factors, could be 
significant. The lower the pressure at a given elevation, the less dense 
the air; the less dense the air, the higher the density altitude and, as 
a result, the less performance the helicopter will have. 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The daily and seasonal variations in atmospheric 
pressure at a given place will not have as significant effect on the 
density altitude as the daily and seasonal variations of temperature 
and moisture.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The density altitude chart is based on pressure 
altitude, not indicated altitude <a href="Chapter_8.html#fig 53">(fig. 51)
</a>. To determine the pressure altitude at any given place, if an 
altimeter is available, adjust the altimeter setting to 29.92 and read the 
pressure altitude directly from the altimeter. However, do not forget to 
reset the altimeter to the current altimeter setting if available, or to 
field elevation if an altimeter setting is not available.

<br><font size=-1>Figure 53.- High temperature reduces helicopter 
performance.</font>
</center>

<p><b><a name="temperature">Temperature</a></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even when elevation and pressure remain constant, 
great changes in air density will be caused by temperature changes. The 
same amount of air that occupies 1 cubic inch at a low temperature will 
expand and occupy 2, 3, or 4 cubic inches as the temperature rises. 
Therefore, as temperature increases, air becomes less dense, density 
altitude is increased, and the helicopter performance decreases 
<a href="Chapter_8.html#fig 53">(fig. 53)</a>. A study of figure 
<a href="Chapter_8.html#fig 51">51</a> easily reveals that, as temperature 
increases, density altitude increases since the pressure altitude lines 
slope upward to the right.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already used the density altitude chart to 
find the density altitude at an elevation of 5,000 feet standard 
atmospheric conditions for that elevation - that is, atmospheric pressure 
(reduced to sea level) 29.92 inches of mercury, temperature 41.5&deg; F. 
(5&deg; C.).

<b><blockquote><blockquote>
	When the atmospheric pressure, reduced to sea level at<br>
	a given elevation, is 29.92, the pressure altitude is<br>
	the same as the given elevation.
</blockquote></blockquote></b>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would be the density altitude at this same 
elevation if the pressure altitude is still 5,000 feet but the temperature 
is 95&deg; F. (35&deg; C.)? Locate the 35&deg; vertical line at the bottom 
of the chart <a href="Chapter_8.html#fig 51">(fig. 51)</a>, follow this 
line up to its intersection with the 5,000-foot pressure altitude 
(diagonal) line, then move horizontally to the left side of the chart 
where a density altitude of 8,400 feet is read. A helicopter operating at 
this elevation under these conditions would be flying in air with a 
density altitude equivalent to that at the 8,400-foot level. Therefore, 
the performance of the helicopter would be as though it were flying at the 
8,400-foot level rather than the 5,000-foot level.

<br><font size=-1>Figure 54.- High humidity (especially on hot days) 
reduces helicopter performance.</font>
</center>

<p><b><a name="moisture">Moisture</a></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When temperature and pressure are constant, changes in 
the moisture content of the air will change air density. Water vapor weighs 
less than dry air. Therefore, as the moisture content of the air increases, 
air becomes less dense; density altitude is increased with a resultant 
decrease in helicopter performance <a href="Chapter_8.html#fig 54">(fig. 54)
</a>. <i>The higher the temperature the greater the amount of moisture the 
air can hold</i>. Relative humidity, which is expressed as a percent, is 
the ratio of the amount of moisture in the air to the amount it is capable 
of absorbing at a given temperature. The moisture content of the air at a 
relative humidity of 80 percent and a temperature of 100&deg; F. will be 
much greater than with a relative humidity of 80 percent and a temperature 
of 50&deg; F. The greatest in air density (increase in density altitude) 
due to moisture content will be at a high temperature.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The density altitude chart 
<a href="Chapter_8.html#fig 51">(fig. 51)</a> does not take 
the moisture content of the air into consideration. <i>It should be 
remembered that the actual density altitude can be much higher than that 
computed from this chart if the air contains a high moisture content</i>. 
The importance of this added effect of moisture will be seen shortly.

<p><b><a name="density">
High density and low density altitude conditions
</a></b>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms &quot;high density altitude&quot; 
and &quot;low density altitude&quot; should be thoroughly understood. In 
general, high density altitude refers to thin air; low density altitude 
refers to dense air. Therefore, those conditions that result in thin 
air - high elevations, high temperatures, high moisture content, or some 
combination thereof - would be referred to as high density altitude 
conditions; those conditions that result in dense air - low elevations, 
low temperatures, low moisture content, or some combination thereof - would 
be referred to as low density altitude conditions. It is important to note 
that high density altitude may be present at low elevations on hot days 
with moisture content in the air.

<br><center><b><font size=+2>EFFECT OF HIGH DENSITY ALTITUDES<br>ON
HELICOPTER PERFORMANCE</font></b></center><br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High elevations, high temperatures, and high moisture 
content, all of which contribute to a high density altitude condition, 
lessen helicopter performance. Because the difference between the power 
available and the power required is so small for a helicopter, particularly 
in hovering flight, density altitude is of even greater importance to the 
helicopter pilot than it is to the airplane pilot. Helicopter performance 
is reduced because the thinner air at high density altitudes reduces the 
amount of lift of the rotor blades. Also, the (unsupercharged) engine does 
not develop as much power because of the thinner air and the decreased 
atmospheric pressure.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High density altitudes reduce the hovering 
capabilities of the helicopter <a href="Chapter_8.html#fig 55">(fig. 55)
</a>. Under any given load condition, the higher the density altitude, the 
lower the hovering ceiling; that is, the elevation at which the helicopter 
will be able to hover will be lowered as the density altitude increases.

</font>
</center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure <a href="Chapter_8.html#fig 56">56</a> 
gives the hovering ceiling in ground effect for one helicopter at various 
gross weights and temperatures both in dry air and air at 80 percent 
relative humidity. The following previously established points should be 
easily recognized from this chart:

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <i>An increase in temperature decreases the 
hovering ceiling</i>. - For example, at 1,600 pounds gross weight in dry 
air, as the temperature increases from -20&deg; F. to 100&deg; F., the 
hovering ceiling decreases from 6,500 feet to 1,300 feet.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <i>As the amount of moisture in the air increases, 
the hovering ceiling decreases</i>. - For example, at 1,600 pounds gross 
weight and 100&deg; F., as the moisture content changes from dry air to 
80 percent relative humidity, the hovering ceiling decreases from 3,000 
feet to 1,300 feet; at 1,600 pounds and 20&deg; F., as the moisture changes 
from dry air to 80 percent relative humidity, the hovering ceiling 
decreases from 5,500 feet to only 5,200 feet.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <i>The higher the temperature, the greater the 
amount of moisture which the air can hold</i>. - At 1,600 pounds gross 
weight, and temperatures of  -20&deg; F., 20&deg; F., 60&deg; F., and 
100&deg; F., the change in hovering ceiling from dry air to 80 percent 
relative humidity is 200 feet, 300 feet, 400 feet, and 1,700 feet, 
respectively. This indicates that the amount of moisture in the air at 
100&deg; F. and 80 percent relative humidity is much greater than the 
amount present at 60&deg; F. and below.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure <a href="Chapter_8.html#fig 57">57</a> 
illustrates the hovering ceiling in ground effect for temperature and gross 
weight variations for one helicopter, but does not reflect the effect that 
moisture content has on the performance. For example, at a gross weight of 
1,550 pounds and a temperature of 100&deg; F., the hovering ceiling is a 
pressure altitude of 4,100 feet.


<p><b>Takeoff</b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For any given gross weight, the higher the density 
altitude at point of departure, the more power that is required to make 
a vertical takeoff to a hover <a href="Chapter_8.html#fig 55">(fig. 55)
</a>. In fact, under certain gross weight and density altitude conditions, 
a helicopter may not have sufficient power to lift off vertically, in which 
case, if takeoff is made, it would have to be a running takeoff.

<br><font size=-1>Figure 58.- Takeoff distance chart.</font>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure <a href="Chapter_8.html#fig 58">58</a> shows a 
chart that is used to compute the takeoff distance required to clear a 
50-foot obstacle under various gross weight, pressure altitude, and 
temperature conditions. A brief study of the chart immediately reveals the 
previously established points, that is, as gross weight, altitude, and 
temperature increase, the takeoff performance decreases. This chart is used 
in the following way:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. In the first column, locate the helicopter gross 
weight.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. In the second column, opposite the gross weight, 
locate the pressure altitude at point of takeoff.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Follow this pressure altitude row out to the column 
headed by the temperature at point of takeoff.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The figure at the intersection of the pressure 
altitude row and the temperature column is the number of feet required for 
this particular helicopter to take off and clear a 50-foot obstacle.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. If the gross weight, pressure altitude, or 
temperature, or any combination of the three, fall between the listed 
values, the interpolation process will have to be used to compute the 
distance.<br>

to clear a 50-foot obstacle if the helicopter gross weight is 2,500 pounds,

<p>Since this chart does not take into consideration the decrease in air 
density due to moisture content, <i>takeoff distances may be even greater 
than those computed from the table</i>.

<p><b><a name="rate of climb">Rate of climb</a></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For any given gross weight, the higher the density 
altitude, the less the rate of climb for any helicopter. Although a 
helicopter may be able to take off and clear obstacles close by, higher 
obstacles farther away may not be cleared because of this reduced rate 
of climb.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure <a href="Chapter_8.html#fig 60">60</a> 
illustrates another type of chart used to compute rate of climb for another 
model helicopter. To use this chart, you must follow these steps:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Compute the density altitude at the departure point 
using the density altitude chart <a href="Chapter_8.html#fig 51">
(figure 51)</a>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Locate this density altitude along the left side of 
the chart <a href="Chapter_8.html#fig 60">(figure 60)</a>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Follow this altitude line horizontally until it 
intersects the diagonal line.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. From this point of intersection, move vertically 
downward to the bottom of the chart where you read the rate of climb 
under existing conditions.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the chart to the right in figure 
<a href="Chapter_8.html#fig 60">60</a>, you can determine the best rate of 
climb airspeed under the various density altitude conditions. From the 
density altitude at the left side of the chart, move horizontally across 
until the line intersects the diagonal line on the right-hand chart. From 
this point of intersection, move vertically downward to the bottom of the 
chart where you read the best rate of climb speed in miles per hour.

<p><b>Landing</b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because a pilot can hover at a takeoff point with a 
certain gross weight, it does not mean that hovering power will be 
available at the destination airport. If the destination is at a higher 
altitude and/or higher temperature and moisture content prevail, sufficient 
power may not be available to hover at the destination with existing gross 
weight. The pilot will have to make a running landing under these 
conditions.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pilot should be able to predict whether hovering 
power will be available at the destination through (1) a knowledge of 
temperature, relative humidity, and wind conditions, (2) the use of charts 
in the helicopter flight manual such as figures 
<a href="Chapter_8.html#fig 56">56</a> and <a href="Chapter_8.html#fig 57">
57</a>, and (3) by making certain power checks in flight prior to 
attempting to land. These power checks will be discussed later.

<a name="sample landing"></a>
Figure <a href="Chapter_8.html#fig 61">61</a> illustrates the type of chart 
that is used to compute the total landing distance over a 50-foot obstacle 
for one model of helicopter. The steps for using this chart are exactly the 
same as those listed previously for the takeoff distance chart. Notice that 
the total landing distance does not vary as much as the total takeoff 
distance <a href="Chapter_8.html#fig 58">(fig. 58)</a> with equal 
variations in gross weight, altitude, or temperature. These charts apply to 
the same helicopter.

<p><center><b><font size=+2><a name="gross weight">
EFFECT OF GROSS WEIGHT<br>
ON HELICOPTER PERFORMANCE</a></font></b></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We learned earlier that the total weight of a 
helicopter is the first force that must be overcome before flight is 
possible. Lift is the force that is needed to overcome or balance this 
total weight. It is easily seen that the greater the gross weight of the 
helicopter, the more lift that is required to hover. The amount of lift 
available is dependent upon the angle of attack at which the rotor blades 
can operate and still maintain required rotor RPM. The angle of attack at 
which the blades can operate at required rotor RPM is dependent upon the 
amount of power available. Therefore, the heavier the gross weight, the 
greater the power required to hover and for flight in general, and the 
poorer the performance of the helicopter since less reserve power is 
available <a href="Chapter_8.html#fig 62">(fig. 62)</a>; or, to state it 
another way, the heavier the gross weight, the lower the hovering ceiling.

<br><font size=-1>Figure 62.- Heavy loads (high gross weights) decrease 
helicopter performance.</font>
</center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A study of the hovering ceiling chart 
<a href="Chapter_8.html#fig 56">(fig. 56)</a> reveals the following 
interesting information for one helicopter, and is fairly typical for all 
helicopters (with unsupercharged engines). At 60&deg; F. in dry air, the 
hovering ceiling for gross weights of 1,300, 1,400, 1,500, and 1,600 pounds 
are 9,400 feet, 7,400 feet, 5,900 feet and 4,300 feet, respectively. An 
increase of 300 pounds in gross weight decreases the hovering ceiling by 
more than half. At gross weights of 1,300, 1,400, 1,500, and 1,600 pounds 
at a temperature of 100&deg; F. in air with a relative humidity of 80 
percent the hovering ceilings are 6,100 feet, 4,400 feet, 2,900 feet, and 
1,300 feet, respectively. In the latter case, an increase of 300 pounds in 
gross weight reduces the hovering ceiling by almost 80 percent. <i>A 
comparison of the two examples illustrates vividly the reduction in 
performance brought about by a combination of heavy gross weight and high 
density altitudes</i>.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the three major factors affecting the performance 
of a helicopter at high elevations (density altitude, wind, and gross 
weight), the pilot can control only the gross weight. It should be obvious 
that the gross weight carried on any flight must be considered - not only 
for takeoff under the existing density altitude, wind conditions, and power 
available at point of departure, but also under the expected density 
altitude, wind conditions, and power available at the landing destination. 
Smaller amounts of fuel may be carried to improve performance or to 
increase useful load. It must be remembered, however, that this 
necessitates a sacrifice in range.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of loading a helicopter within the 
approved center-of-gravity limits, and the ill effects on performance if 
this is not properly accomplished, have been discussed in the preceding 
chapter.

<p><center><b><font size=+2><a name="wind">EFFECT OF WIND<br>
ON HELICOPTER PERFORMANCE</a></font></b></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen earlier that when the horizontal 
airspeed of the helicopter reaches approximately 15 miles per hour, an 
abrupt increase in lift is experienced. This we call effective 
translational lift. Actually, from the moment the helicopter begins forward 
flight, translational lift is present, but is not very apparent or 
effective under about 15 miles per hour.

<br><font size=-1>Figure 63.- Calm wind reduces helicopter hovering 
performance.</font>
</center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Translational lift is created by airspeed, not 
groundspeed. Therefore, translational lift is also present when the 
helicopter is hovering in a wind. If the wind velocity is 15 miles per 
hour or more, the helicopter will be experiencing effective translational 
lift in a hover. Due to this increased lift, less power will be required 
to hover than would be required for hovering in a no wind condition 
<a href="Chapter_8.html#fig 63">(fig. 63)</a>; or, a greater gross weight 
could be carried when takeoff is to be made in a wind exceeding 15 miles 
per hour than could be made in a no-wind condition.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No-wind conditions increase the amount of power 
necessary to hover, or require that a lighter load be carried. <i>Thus, 
no-wind conditions reduce helicopter performance</i>. Since wind decreases 
the power required for hovering, or permits taking off or landing with 
greater loads, helicopter performance is improved. If the wind exceeds 15 
miles per hour, performance is improved considerably; however, wind gusts 
over 30 to 35 miles per hour may tend to destroy the additional lift 
obtained between 15 and 30 miles per hour.

<p><center><b><font size=+2>PRACTICAL METHODS FOR PREDICTING<br>
HELICOPTER PERFORMANCE</font></b></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain practical methods for predicting helicopter 
performance were developed through engineering and flight tests for a 
particular model helicopter used by the Army. These practical methods 
for this particular helicopter are given in this handbook <i>to give 
the reader a clearer understanding of factors influencing helicopter 
performance, and sound principles on which to base flight decisions</i>. 
We wish to emphasize the fact that these rules are for a particular 
helicopter used by the Army and the actual figures will apply only to 
this particular helicopter. Even though such practical aids are developed 
for a helicopter, they should not be used as substitutes for experience 
and good judgment.

<p><b><a name="manifold pressure and payload">
Manifold pressure and payload
</a></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tests on this particular helicopter showed that 1 
inch of manifold pressure was equivalent to 6 horsepower (HP), and that 
1 HP would lift 13.5 pounds of weight while hovering. When combined, these 
two facts give rise to this practical rule:
<b><blockquote><font size=-1>
Rule No. 1 - One inch of manifold pressure will lift 80 pounds of payload.
</font></blockquote></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this knowledge, the pilot can obtain an estimate 
of the additional weight that can safely be carried to hover and then 
enter flight. This rule may be applied before landing at destination in 
this manner:<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Momentarily, apply full throttle at 100 feet, or less, 
above the ground and determine the maximum manifold pressure that can be 
obtained. This will be approximately equal to the maximum manifold pressure 
available for takeoff.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. While hovering, check manifold pressure required for 
the hover.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Find the difference between maximum available manifold 
pressure and manifold pressure required to hover.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The difference in manifold pressure changed into its 
equivalent in weight (1 inch of manifold pressure is equivalent to 80 
pounds) gives the approximate additional payload which can be carried to 
lift to a hover for safe takeoff.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temperature, winds, altitude, and gross weight are 
included in the above practical method for this particular helicopter, and 
need not be considered separately.

<p><b>Manifold pressure and hovering ceiling</b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By using available manifold pressure to determine 
hovering ceiling, a pilot can predict whether or not hovering flight is 
possible at the destination.
<b><blockquote><font size=-1>
	Rule No. 2 - If wind velocity at point of intended landing<br>
	is approximately the same as at point of takeoff, and the<br>
	flight is made within the same air mass (no radical temperature<br>
	change), for each inch of manifold pressure in excess of that<br>
	required to hover, add 1,00 feet to the point-of-takeoff<br>
	altitude. This computed altitude will represent the approximate<br>
	hovering ceiling.
</font></blockquote></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This practical rule may be applied as follows:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Check manifold pressure at a normal hover prior 
to departure.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. While hovering, momentarily apply full throttle 
and note the maximum manifold pressure available.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The difference in these two manifold pressure 
reading is equivalent to 1,000 feet altitude per inch of excess manifold 
pressure. This additional altitude added to the point-of-takeoff altitude 
will give the maximum altitude (above sea level) at which the helicopter 
may be hovered (in ground effect).

<p><b><a name="payload and wind">Payload and wind</a></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In winds from 0 to 15 miles per hour, the hovering 
ceiling of the helicopter will increase about 100 feet for each mile per 
hour of wind. In windspeed from about 15 MPH to 26 MPH, the hovering 
ceiling will increase about 350 feet for each mile per hour of wind.
<b><blockquote><font size=-1>
	Rule No. 3 - The payload may be increased 8 pounds<br>
	for each mile per hour of wind from 0 to 15 miles per<br>
	hour, or may be increased 28 pounds for each mile<br>
	per hour of wind from 15 MPH to 26 MPH.
</font></blockquote></b>
<p><b>Hovering and skid height</b>

 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hovering altitude over level terrain for this 
particular helicopter is ideal with a skid clearance of approximately 4 
feet (height of skid above the ground). Variable hovering altitudes, due 
to obstacles or rough terrain, have a decided effect on helicopter 
performance in determining hovering ceiling and payload. These effects 
are best estimated as follows:
<b><blockquote><font size=-1>
	Rule No. 4 - (1) To hover under 4 feet, add 300 feet<br>
	to the hovering ceiling or 24 pounds to the payload<br>
	for each 6 inches of decrease in skid height from the<br>
	4-foot hover. (2) To hover between 4 feet and 10 feet,<br>
	subtract 300 feet from the hovering ceiling or 24<br>
	pounds from the payload for each foot of increase in<br>
	skid height.
</font></blockquote></b>
<p><b>Hovering ceiling and gross weight</b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hovering ceiling will vary in proportion to the 
gross weight of the helicopter. To determine hovering ceiling for a known 
gross weight, apply the following rule:
<b><blockquote><font size=-1>
	Rule No. 5 - (1) A 100-pound REDUCTION in gross<br>
	weight increases hovering ceiling in or out of<br>
	ground effect above 1,300 feet. (2) A 100-pound<br>
	INCREASE in gross weight decreases hovering<br>
	ceiling about 1,300 feet.
</font></blockquote></b>
<a name="service ceiling">Service ceiling and gross weight</a>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The service ceiling of the helicopter varies with 
gross weight. (For all practical purposes, service ceiling is the maximum 
obtainable altitude.) To determine the effects of gross weight on service 
ceiling, apply the following rule:
<b><blockquote><font size=-1>
	Rule No. 6 - A 100-pound DECREASE in gross weight<br>
	adds 800 feet to the service ceiling, and, conversely,<br>
	a 100-pound INCREASE in gross weight reduces the<br>
	service ceiling 800 feet.
</font></blockquote></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We wish to reemphasize that these rules are for one 
particular helicopter used by the Army and the actual figures will apply 
only to this helicopter.

<p><center><b><font size=+2>BRIEF SUMMARY</font></b></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thumbnail summary of this chapter might be as 
follows:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The most favorable conditions for helicopter 
performance are the combination of a low-density altitude, light gross 
weight, and moderate to strong wind (fig, 64).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The most adverse conditions for helicopter performance 
are the combination of a high density altitude, heavy gross weight, and 
calm or no wind <a href="Chapter_8.html#fig 64">(fig. 64)</a>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Any other combination of density altitude, gross 
weight, and wind conditions falls somewhere between the most adverse 
conditions and the most favorable conditions.
