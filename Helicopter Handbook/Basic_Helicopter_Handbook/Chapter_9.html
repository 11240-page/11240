<br><font size=+2>SOME HAZARDS OF HELICOPTER FLIGHT</font>
</b></center>

<p><b><a name="blade stall">Retreating blade stall</a></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tendency for the retreating blade to stall in forward 
flight is inherent in all present-day helicopters, and is a major factor in 
limiting their forward airspeed. Basically, the stall of the wing limits the 
low airspeed capabilities of the airplane. <i>The stall of a rotor blade 
limits the high airspeed potential of a helicopter</i>. The airflow over the 
retreating blade of the helicopter slows down as forward airspeed of the 
helicopter increases; the airflow over the advancing blade speeds up as 
forward airspeed increases. The retreating blade must, however, produce the 
same amount of lift as the advancing blade. Therefore, as the airflow over 
the retreating blade decreases with forward airspeed, the blade angle of 
attack must be increased to help equalize lift throughout the rotor disc 
area. As this increase in angle of attack is continued, the retreating blade 
will stall at some high forward airspeed. The advancing blade has relatively 
low angles of attack and is not subject to blade stall. Blade stall occurs 
during powered flight at the tip of the retreating blade, spreading inboard 
as forward airspeed increases. Retreating blade stall does not occur in 
normal autorotations.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When operating at <i>high forward airspeeds</i>, stalls 
are more likely to occur under conditions of:

<blockquote>
1-High gross weight.<br>
2-Low RPM.<br>
3-High density altitude.<br>
4-Steep or abrupt turns.<br>
5-Turbulent air.
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major warnings of approaching retreating blade 
stall conditions in the order in which they will generally be experienced 
are:

<blockquote>
1-Abnormal 2 per revolution vibration in two-bladed rotors or 
3 per revolution vibration in three-bladed rotors.<br>
2-Pitchup of the nose.<br>
3-Tendency for the helicopter to roll.
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the onset of blade stall vibration, the pilot should 
take the following corrective measures:

<blockquote>
1-Reduce collective pitch.<br>
2-Increase rotor RPM.<br>
3-Reduce forward airspeed.<br>
4-Minimize maneuvering.
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When operating under flight conditions likely to 
produce blade stall, a helicopter may quickly advance into severe blade 
stall by a steep turn, pullup, or other abrupt maneuver. The stall reaction 
will be rapid and violent. The vibrations, pitchup, and roll tendencies of 
the helicopter will present a serious threat to helicopter control and 
structural limitations. When flight conditions are such that blade 
stall is likely, caution should be exercised when maneuvering.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="never-exceed airspeed">
As the altitude increases, the never-exceed airspeed</a> (red line) for most 
helicopters decreases. Figure <a href="Chapter_9.html#fig 65">65</a> shows a 
chart from the helicopter flight manual for one model from which the V<font 
size=-1>ne</font> (never exceed) speed can be determined for the various 
altitudes. At sea level, V<font size=-1>ne</font> is 86 miles per hour; at 
6,000 feet and 2500 RPM, it is 65 MPH; and at 6,000 feet and 2700-2900 RPM, 
it is 78 MPH. This chart immediately points up the effect that rotor RPM has 
on the airspeed at which retreating blade stall is experienced.

<p><b><a name="settling with power">Settling with power</a></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This condition of flight is sometimes described as 
settling in your own downwash. It involves high vertical rates of descent, 
and the addition of more power produces an even greater rate of descent. The 
helicopter is descending in turbulent air that has just been accelerated 
downward by the rotor. Reaction of this air on rotor blades at high 
angles of attack stalls the blades at the hub (center of the rotor) and 
the stall progresses outward along the blade as the rate of descent 
increases. The following combination of conditions are likely to cause 
settling with power:

<blockquote>
   1-A vertical or nearly vertical descent of at least 300 feet per 
minute. Actual critical rate depends on the gross weight, RPM, density 
altitude, and other pertinent factors.<br>
   2-The rotor system must be using some of the available engine power 
(from 20 to 100 percent).<br>
   3-The horizontal velocity must be no greater than approximately 10 
miles per hour.
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pilot may experience settling with power 
accidentally. Situations that are conducive to a settling-with-power 
conditions are:
<blockquote>

   1-Attempting to hover out of ground effect at altitudes above the 
hovering ceiling of the helicopter;<br>
   2-Attempting to hover out of ground effect without maintaining 
precise altitude control; or<br>
   3-A steep power approach in which airspeed is permitted to drop 
nearly to zero.
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recovering from a settling-with-power condition, the 
tendency on the part of the pilot to first try to stop the descent by 
increasing collective pitch will result in increasing the stalled area of 
the rotor and increasing the rate of descent. Since inboard portions of the 
blades are stalled, cyclic control will be reduced. Recovery can be 
accomplished by increasing forward speed, and/or partially lowering 
collective pitch.

<p><b><a name="ground resonance">Ground resonance</a></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ground resonance may develop when a series of shocks 
cause the rotor head to become unbalanced. This condition, if allowed to 
progress, can be extremely dangerous and usually results in structural 
failure. In general, if ground resonance occurs, it will occur only in 
helicopters possessing three-bladed, fully articulated rotor systems and 
landing wheels. The rotor blades in a three-bladed helicopter are equally 
spaced around the rotor hub (120&deg; apart), but are constructed to allow 
some horizontal movement. This horizontal movement is called lead and 
lag (drag), and the vertical hinge that makes this possible is the drag 
hinge.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the name implies, ground resonance occurs when the 
helicopter makes contact with the surface during landing or while in contact 
with the surface during an attempted takeoff. When one landing gear of the 
helicopter strikes the surface first, a shock is transmitted through the 
fuselage to the rotor. This shock may cause the blades straddling the 
contact point to be forced closer together. The spacing might then be 
122&deg;, 122&deg;, and 116&deg;. When one of the other landing 
gears strikes, the unbalance could be aggravated and become even greater. 
This establishes a resonance which sets up a pendulum like oscillation 
of the fuselage-a severe wobbling or shaking similar to the oscillations 
of a silver dollar, or similar object, when dropped striking the floor 
at an angle. Unless immediate corrective action is taken, the oscillation 
will increase rapidly and destruction of the helicopter will result. 
Corrective action could be an immediate takeoff if RPM is in proper 
range, or an immediate closing of the throttle and placing the blades in 
low pitch if RPM is low.

<p><center><b><font size=+1>
<a name="vibrations">ABNORMAL VIBRATIONS</a>
</font></b></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abnormal vibrations in the helicopter will generally 
fall into three ranges:

<blockquote>
   1-Low frequency-100 to 400 cycles per minute (cpm).<br>
   2-Medium frequency-1,000 to 2,000 cpm.<br>
   3-High frequency-2,000 cpm or higher.
</blockquote>

<p><b><a name="low-frequency vibrations">Low-frequency vibrations</a></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abnormal vibrations in this category are always 
associated with the main rotor. The vibration will be some frequency related 
to the rotor RPM and the number of blades of the rotor, such as one 
vibration per revolution (1 per rev.), 2 per rev., or 3 per rev. 
Low-frequency vibrations are slow enough that they can be counted.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frequency and the strength of the vibration will 
cause the pilot or passengers to be bounced or shaken noticeably. If the 
vibration is felt through the cyclic stick, it will have the same definite 
kick at the same point in the cycle. These low-frequency vibrations may be 
felt only in the fuselage or only in the stick or they may be evident in 
both at the same time. Whether the tremor is in the fuselage or stick will, 
to some extent, determine the cause.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those vibrations felt through the fuselage may be 
classified in three ways-lateral, longitudinal, or vertical-or they may be 
some combination of the three. A lateral vibration is one which throws the 
pilot from side to side. A longitudinal vibration is one which throws the 
pilot forward and backward, or in which the pilot receives a periodic kick 
in the back. A vertical vibration is one in which the pilot is bounced up 
and down, or it may be thought of as one in which the pilot receives a 
periodic kick in the seat of the pants. Describing the vibrations to the 
mechanic in this way will also allow a determination be made as to the cause.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the vibration is felt definitely in both the stick 
and fuselage, the cause is generally in the rotor or rotor support. A 
failure of the pylon support at the fuselage is also a possible cause.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the low-frequency vibration in the fuselage occurs 
only during translational flight or during a climb at certain airspeeds, the 
vibration may be a result of the blades striking the blade rest stops. This 
can be eliminated by avoiding the flight condition that causes it.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For low-frequency vibrations felt predominantly 
through the stick, the most likely place to look for trouble is in the 
control system linkage from the stick to the rotor head.

<p>
<b><a name="medium-frequency vibrations">Medium-frequency vibrations</a></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medium-frequency vibrations are a result of trouble 
with the tail rotor in most helicopters. Improper rigging, unbalance, 
defective blades, or bad bearings in the tail rotor are all sources of these 
vibrations. If the vibration occurs only during turns, the trouble may be 
caused by insufficient tail rotor flapping action. Medium frequency 
vibrations will be difficult if not impossible to count due to the fast rate.

<p><b><a name="high-frequency vibrations">High-frequency vibrations</a></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High-frequency vibrations are associated with the 
engine in most helicopters, and will be impossible to count due to the high 
rate. However, they could be associated with the tail rotor RPM is 
approximately equal to or greater than the engine RPM. A defective clutch or 
missing or bent fan blades will cause vibrations which should be corrected. 
Any bearings in the engine or transmission or the tail rotor drive shaft 
that go bad will result in vibrations with frequency directly related to the 
speed of the engine.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experience in detecting and isolating the three 
different classes of vibrations when they first develop makes it possible 
to correct the vibrations long before they become serious.

<p><center><font size=+1><b><a name="autorotations">TRANSITION FROM POWERED 
FLIGHT TO AUTOROTATION</a></b></font></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obvious that there are some transitions that are 
necessary in establishing and stabilizing a helicopter in autorotative 
flight following a power failure. A power failure immediately results in a 
dissipation of rotor RPM while the airflow through the rotor system is 
changing from the downward flow present in powered flight to the upward flow 
occurring during autorotative flight. Rotor RPM decreases at a rapid rate if 
immediate action is not taken to decrease the pitch angle of the rotor 
blades. This decrease continues (even after the upward flow of air has 
stabilized) to the point that controlled flight may not even be possible 
depending upon the pitch angle at the time of power failure. After the pitch 
angle is lessened and the upward flow of air stabilizes, the rate of descent 
will not stabilize at its minimum until the rotor RPM builds back up to its 
maximum for that particular pitch angle setting and helicopter gross weight.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The successful entry from powered flight to 
autorotation consists of the following transitions:

<blockquote>
   1-Changing of airflow from a downward flow to an upward flow<br>
   2-Lowering collective pitch to maintain a tolerable angle of attack 
which would otherwise increase because of the descent.<br>
   3-Regaining rotor RPM and stabilizing rate of descent.
</blockquote>

<p>The magnitude of these transitions depends on the mode of flight.

<br>If power failure occurs in a descent, there is very little transition. A 
vertical climb requires large transitions because of the high rotor blade 
pitch angle required for the vertical climb.

<p><b><a name="alt vs air">Altitude versus airspeed charts</a></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure <a href="Chapter_9.html#fig 66">66</a> is an 
airspeed vs. altitude limitations chart excerpted from the helicopter flight 
manual for one helicopter. This type of chart is often referred to as the 
&quot;height-velocity curve diagram&quot; or &quot;dead man's curve.&quot; 
Such charts are prepared by the manufacturer and, as required by 
regulations, are published in the helicopter flight manual generally under 
the performance section.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A helicopter pilot must become familiar with this 
chart for the particular helicopter being flown. From it, the determination 
as to what altitudes and airspeeds are required to safely make an 
autorotative landing in case of an engine failure; or. to restate it in 
another way, the chart can be used to determine those altitude-airspeed 
combinations from which it would be nearly impossible to successfully 
complete an autorotative landing. The altitude-airspeed combinations that 
should be avoided are represented by the shaded areas of the chart.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine the difficulty of entering and establishing a 
stabilized autorotation from the shaded areas of the &quot;dead man's 
curve&quot; <a href="Chapter_9.html#fig 66">(fig. 66)</a>. This chart is 
assuming the lack of vertical velocity and acceleration (that is, flight at 
a constant altitude and airspeed) and that an engine failure in these areas 
is complete and instantaneous. In either of these shaded areas, it would be 
nearly impossible to complete all the transitions to autorotation before the 
helicopter would be at ground level. When the helicopter is &quot;pushed 
over&quot; (that is, when the nose is lowered) into a glide, the rotor 
system angle of attack is diminished. This causes the helicopter to 
accelerate downward and lengthens the time required to complete the 
autorotational transitions. That is, the time required for the helicopter 
airspeed, rotor RPM, and rate of descent to stabilize would be greater than 
if the helicopter were already in the autorotative descending attitude with 
best autorotational airspeed at the time of engine failure.

</center>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In case of engine failure in low altitude, low 
airspeed area of figure <a href="Chapter_9.html#fig 66">66</a> (area A), a 
choice must be made by the pilot either to &quot;freeze&quot; the collective 
pitch to save the remaining rotor RPM and upward collective travel for 
cushioning the ground contact, or to lower the collective pitch all the way, 
or to partially lower the collective pitch so that more upward collective 
travel will be available to cushion the ground contact. It is strictly a 
judgment decision on the part of the pilot based upon personal skill, 
experience, and knowledge of the helicopter and the altitude-airspeed 
combination at the time of engine failure. In any case, the rate of descent 
at ground contact will be much greater than it would be from a normal 
autorotation in which all transitions could be made in time for the rate of 
descent to stabilize.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the low altitude, high airspeed area of figure 
<a href="Chapter_9.html#fig 66">66</a> (area B), the pilot's immediate 
choice is to flare or lower collective pitch or to decide how much of each 
may be done. The type of landing area would be a factor in this instance; 
however, even though a smooth landing area of sufficient length is 
available, the pilot still risks a high-speed landing in an aircraft which 
is not stressed for it.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ascent of the helicopter in area &quot;A&quot; and 
forward acceleration in area &quot;B&quot; make the occurrence of a power 
failure doubly hazardous because of the magnitude of the induced airflow 
and collective pitch transitions required to enter a stabilized 
autorotation. A glide through either area is much less hazardous in case of 
power failure because most of the transitions have already been accomplished.


<p><center><font size=+1><b>
<a name="antitorque sys failure">ANTITORQUE SYSTEM FAILURE</a>
</b></font></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antitorque system failure could be the result of a 
failure in the tail rotor blades, a failure in the mechanical linkage 
between the pedals and the pitch-change mechanism of the tail rotor, or 
a failure in the tail rotor drive shaft between the transmission and the 
tail rotor.

<p><b>Antitorque system failure in forward cruising flight</b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the antitorque system fails in forward cruising 
flight, the nose of the helicopter will usually pitch slightly and yaw to 
the right. The direction in which the nose will pitch depends on the 
particular helicopter and how it is loaded. Violence of pitching and yawing 
is generally greater when the failure occurs in the tail rotor blades and 
is usually accompanied by severe vibration.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pitching and yawing can be overcome by holding the 
cyclic stick near neutral and entering autorotation. Cyclic control 
movements should be kept to a minimum until all pitching subsides. Avoid 
abrupt rearward movements of the cyclic stick. If it is moved rearward 
abruptly, the main rotor blades could flex downward with sufficient force to 
strike the tail boom. If unsuitable terrain exists, cautiously add power to 
determine if flight can be continued to an acceptable landing area. If 
dangerous attitudes are incurred due to this addition of power, re-enter 
autorotation.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If sufficient forward speed is maintained, the 
fuselage remains fairly well streamlined; however, if descent is attempted 
at slow speeds, a continuous turning movement to the left can be expected. 
(Know the manufacturer's recommendations in case of tail rotor failure for 
each particular helicopter you fly. This will generally be found under 
Emergency Procedures in the helicopter flight manual.) Directional control 
should be maintained primarily with cyclic control and, secondarily, by 
gently applying throttle momentarily, with needles joined, to swing the nose 
to the right.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A landing may be made with forward speed or by 
flaring, The best and safest landing technique, terrain permitting, is to 
land directly into the wind with approximately 20 miles per hour airspeed. 
The helicopter will turn to the left during the flare and during the 
subsequent vertical descent. An important factor to remember is that the 
helicopter should be level or approximately level at ground contact.

<p><b>Antitorque system failure while hovering</b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the antitorque system fails during hovering flight, 
quick action must be taken by the pilot. The turning motion to the right 
builds up rapidly because of the torque reaction produced by the relatively 
high-power setting. The throttle should be closed immediately (without 
varying collective pitch position) to eliminate this turning effect. 
Simultaneously, the cyclic stick should be used to stop all sideward or 
rearward movements and to place the helicopter in the landing attitude prior 
to touchdown. From this point, the procedure for a hovering autorotation 
<a href="Chapter_11.html#hover autorotation">(Chapter 11)</a> should be followed.
