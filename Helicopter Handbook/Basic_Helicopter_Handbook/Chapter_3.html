<br><font size=+2>LOADS AND LOAD FACTORS</font>
</b></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before discussing loads and load factors, it is first 
necessary to discuss the lift forces during turns.

<p><b><a name="lift components">Lift components of a turn</a></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turns are made in a helicopter, as in an airplane, by 
banking. In forward flight, the rotor disc is tilted forward which also 
tilts the total lift-thrust force of the rotor disc forward. This total 
force is the resultant of a vertical component, lift, and a horizontal 
component, thrust, acting forward. When the helicopter is placed in a bank, 
the rotor disc is tilted sideward. This causes the lift component to be 
tilted sideward, which in turn, is divided into two components--one 
acting vertically that opposes weight, the other acting horizontally 
to the side and opposes centrifugal force <a href="chapter_3.html#fig 24">
(fig. 24)</a>. It is this horizontal component of lift that pulls the 
helicopter in the direction of bank and thus causes it to turn. Briefly 
then, we can say that <i>a turn is produced by banking the helicopter, thus 
allowing the lift of the rotor disc to pull the helicopter from its straight 
course.</i>

</center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the angle of bank increases, the total lift force 
is tilted more toward the horizontal, thus causing the rate of turn to 
increase because more lift is acting horizontally. Since the resultant 
lifting force acts more horizontally, the effect of lift acting vertically 
(vertical component) is decreased <a href="chapter_3.html#fig 25">
(fig. 25)</a>. To compensate for this decreased vertical lift, the angle of 
attack of the rotor blades must be increased in order to maintain altitude. 
The steeper the angle of bank, the greater the angle of attack of the rotor 
blades required to maintain altitude. Thus, with an increase in bank and a 
greater angle of attack, the resultant lifting force will be increased and 
the rate of turn will be faster.

<p><b><a name="loads">Loads</a></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helicopter strength is measured basically by the 
total load the rotor blades are capable of carrying without permanent 
damage. The load imposed upon the rotor blades depends largely on the 
type of flight. The blades must support not only the weight of the 
helicopter and its contents (gross weight), but also the additional loads 
imposed during maneuvers.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In straight-and-level flight, the rotor blades 
support a weight equal to the helicopter and its contents. So long as 
the helicopter is moving at a constant altitude and airspeed in a straight 
line, the load on the blades remains constant. When the helicopter assumes 
a curved flightpath--all types of turns (except hovering turns utilizing 
pedals only), flares, and pullouts from dives--the actual load on the 
blades will be much greater because of the centrifugal force produced by 
the curved flight. This additional load results in the development of much 
greater stresses on the rotor blades.

<p><b><a name="load factor">Load factor</a></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The load factor is the actual load on the rotor blades 
at any time, divided by the normal load or gross weight (weight of the 
helicopter and its contents). Any time a helicopter flies in a curved 
flightpath, the load supported by the rotor blades is greater than the 
total weight of the helicopter. The tighter the curved flightpath, that is, 
the steeper the bank, or rapid the flare or pullout from a dive, the greater 
the load factor.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The load factor and, hence, apparent gross weight 
increase is relatively small in banks up to 30&deg; 
<a href="chapter_3.html#fig 26">(fig. 26)</a>. Even so, under the right set 
of adverse circumstances, such as high-density altitude, gusty air, high 
gross weight, and poor pilot technique, sufficient power may not be 
available to maintain altitude and airspeed. Above 30&deg; of bank, the 
apparent increase in gross weight soars. At 30&deg; of bank, the apparent 
increase is only 16 percent, but at 60&deg;, it is 100 percent 
<a href="chapter_3.html#fig 26">(fig. 26)</a>.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the weight of the helicopter is 1,600 pounds, the 
weight supported by the rotor in a 30&deg; bank at a constant altitude 
would be 1,856 pounds (1,600 + 256). In a 60&deg; bank, it would be 3,200 
pounds; and in an 80&deg; bank, it would be almost six times as much 
or 8,000 pounds.
<a name="turbulence"></a>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One additional cause of large load factor is rough or 
turbulent air. The severe vertical gusts produced by turbulence can cause 
a sudden increase in angle of attack, resulting in increased rotor blade 
loads that are resisted by the inertia of the helicopter.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be certificated by FAA, each helicopter must have 
a maximum permissible limit load factor that should not be exceeded. As a 
pilot you should have the basic information necessary to fly a helicopter 
safely within its structural limitations. Be familiar with the 
situations in which the load factor may approach maximum, and avoid 
them. If you meet such situations inadvertently, you must know the 
proper technique.
