</font></b>
</center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pilots are responsible for knowing all pertinent 
information for each helicopter they fly. The helicopter flight manual 
is designed to provided pilots with a general knowledge of the particular 
helicopter and the information necessary for safe and efficient operation. 
Its function is not to teach a pilot to fly, but rather to provide the 
best possible operating instructions under most circumstances. It is not 
intended as a substitute for sound judgment; emergencies or other 
unforeseen situations may require modification of the procedures.<i> A 
thorough understanding of the contents of helicopter flight manual will 
enable pilots to complete flights with maximum efficiency and safety.</i>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A helicopter flight manual accompanies each 
certificated helicopter. Although the manual for a particular helicopter 
may contain much information identical to that contained in the flight 
manual for other helicopters of the same make and model, it may also 
contain information which is peculiar only to that helicopter, especially 
weight and balance information. Helicopter flight manuals are prepared 
and furnished by the manufacturers. Much of the information in them is 
required by Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 27, Airworthiness Standards: 
Normal Category Rotorcraft. However, manufacturers often include additional 
information that is helpful to the pilot but which is not required.&nbsp;

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the helicopter flight manual contains information 
required by regulations that does not appear as placards in the helicopter, 
the manual must be carried in the helicopter at all times. The statement: 
&quot;This document must be carried in the aircraft at all times&quot; will 
appear somewhere on the manual if such conditions exist.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information required by regulations to be included 
in the helicopter flight manual is generally listed as follows under 
chapters, sections, headings, or some similar breakdown:

<blockquote>
Operating Limitations<br>
Operating Procedures<br>
Performance Information
</blockquote>

<p><b><a name="limitations">Operating limitations</a></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All important operating limitations that must be 
observed during normal operations are covered in this portion of the 
flight manual. This includes airspeed and rotor limitations, powerplant 
limitations, weight and loading distribution, flight crew, type of 
operation, and unusable fuel if the unusable supply in any tank exceeds 
1 gallon or 5 percent of the tank capacity. A brief discussion of each 
of these, along with actual examples excerpted from various FAA-approved 
helicopter flight manual follows.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i><a name="airspeed">Airspeed limitations</a></i>
.--Required information
includes those limiting airspeed which must be shown on the airspeed 
indicator by a color coding or must be displayed in the form of a placard. 
A red radial line must be placed on the airspeed limit beyond which 
operation is dangerous (never-exceed speed V<font size=-1>ne</font>); a 
yellow arc is used to indicate cautionary operating ranges; and a green 
arc is used to indicate safe or normal operating ranges. Here are excerpts 
from this portion of various helicopter flight manuals:

<center><table WIDTH="70%"><tr><td>
V<font size=-1>ne</font> 100 MPH from sea level to 2000 feet.
</td></tr><tr><td>
Above 2000 feet, decrease V<font size=-1>ne</font> 3 MPH per 1000 feet.
</td></tr><tr><td><table COLS=4 WIDTH="50%">
<tr ALIGN=CENTER><td>&nbsp;</td><td>*</td><td>*</td><td>*</td>

V<font size=-1>ne</font> 105 MPH sea level to 6000 feet.
</td></tr><tr><td>
Above 6000 feet, decrease V<font size=-1>ne</font> 5 MPH per 1000 feet.
</td></tr></table></center>

<br>
<p>This information is sometimes given in the form of a chart 
<a href="chapter_6.html#fig 39">(fig. 39)</a>.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i><a name="rotor">Rotor limitations</a></i>
.--Required information in 
this section of the manual includes limiting rotor RPM's and cautionary 
ranges. These limitations are marked on the tachometer by red radial lines 
and yellow arcs respectively, with normal operating ranges marked with a 
green arc. Here are excerpts from two helicopter flight manuals:

<center><table WIDTH="70%"><tr><td>
Maximum 370 RPM; minimum 333 RPM.
</td></tr><tr><td><table COLS=4 WIDTH="50%">
<tr ALIGN=CENTER><td>&nbsp;</td><td>*</td><td>*</td><td>*</td>
</tr></table></td></tr><tr><td>
Maximum 500 RPM for 248-40, -46, -53 blades.
</td></tr><tr><td>
Maximum 472 RPM for 248-100, and -101 blades.
</td></tr><tr><td>
Minimum 400 RPM.
</td></tr></table></center>

<p>In the latter case, pilots must know the type of rotor blade used on 
their particular helicopter.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i><a name="powerplant">Powerplant limitations</a></i>
.--Information contained 
in this portion must explain all powerplant limitations and the required 
markings on the powerplant instruments. This will include such items as 
fuel octane rating, idling RPM, operating RPM, manifold pressure, oil 
pressure, oil temperature, cylinder head temperature, fuel pressure, 
mixture control, and others. See figure <a href="chapter_6.html#fig 40">

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><a name="cg">Weight and loading distribution</a>
</i>.--This section 
must include rotorcraft weights and center-of-gravity limits, together 
with the items of equipment on which the empty weight is based. This will 
generally require the inclusion of a chart or graph such as that 
illustrated in figure <a href="chapter_6.html#fig 41">41</a> from which the 
pilot can compute the center-of-gravity position for any given loading 
situation. <a href="Chapter_7.html#wandb">(See weight and balance 
information for instructions on the use of this chart.)</a>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><a name="crew">Flight crew</a></I>.-- When a flight 
crew of more than one is required, the number and functions of the minimum 
flight crew will be described.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Type of operation</i>.--Examples of statements 
appearing in helicopter flight manuals for light helicopters are:

<blockquote>Basic configuration of the helicopter permits its use as a 
two-place aircraft. The basic helicopter is approved for VFR operations.
</blockquote><center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center>
<blockquote>Basic configuration of the helicopter permits its use as a 
three-place aircraft.</blockquote><br><br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i><a name="useable fule">Unusable fuel</a></i>
.--If the unusable fuel supply 
in any tank exceeds 1 gallon or 5 percent of the tank capacity, whichever 
is greater, a warning shall be provided to indicate to the flight personnel 
that when the quantity indicator reads zero the remaining fuel in the tank 
cannot be used for flight.

<p><b><a name="operating procedures">Operating procedures</a></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This section of the manual contains information 
concerning normal and emergency procedures, takeoff and landing 
procedures, appropriate airspeeds peculiar to the rotorcraft's operating 
characteristics, and other pertinent information necessary for safe 
operation. This section may include, but not necessarily all, the 
following procedures: a preflight checklist; before starting engine, 
starting, warmup, and shutdown procedures; inflight procedures; and such 
emergency procedures as engine failure, tail rotor failure, hydraulic 
boost failure, ditching with and without power, and others. The following 
is an excerpt from one flight manual on the emergency procedure to use in 
case of engine failure.

<table WIDTH="100%"><tr VALIGN=TOP><td>1.</td><td>
Engine failure while hovering or on takeoff below 10 feet: A power failure 
is indicated by a sudden yawing of the ship to the left. In the event of 
such failure, do not reduce collective pitch. Apply right pedal to prevent 
excessive yawing. Apply collective pitch as necessary in order to cushion 
landing.</td></tr><tr VALIGN=TOP><td>2.</td><td>
Engine failure during takeoff: altitude above 10 feet, below 500 feet: 
Caution: To effect a safe autorotation landing in the event of engine 
failure, takeoff operation should be conducted in accordance with the 
restrictions shown on Height- Velocity diagram. In the event of power 
failure during takeoff, the collective pitch must be initially lowered 
in order that the rotor speed may be maintained. The amount and duration 
of collective reduction depends upon the height above the ground at which 
the engine failure occurs. As the ground is approached, back cyclic and 
collective should be used as needed to decreased forward and vertical 
velocity. Ground contact should be established in a level attitude.
</td></tr><tr VALIGN=TOP><td>3.</td><td>
Engine failure above 500 feet altitude:

<table WIDTH="100%"><tr VALIGN=TOP><td>a.</td><td>
Enter normal autorotation.
</td></tr><tr VALIGN=TOP><td>b.</td><td>
Establish a steady glide of 61 to 63 MPH IAS.
</td></tr><tr VALIGN=TOP><td>c.</td><td>
At an altitude of about 50 feet, begin to steadily apply 
aft cyclic stick pressure to decrease forward speed.
</td></tr><tr VALIGN=TOP><td>d.</td><td>
At approximately 10 feet, coordinate collective pitch with 
aft movement of cyclic stick to cushion landing. At ground 
contact, a level landing on the skid is accomplished.
</td></tr><tr VALIGN=TOP><td>e.</td><td>
Avoid rapid lowering of collective pitch.
</td></tr><tr VALIGN=TOP><td>f.</td><td>
In event of engine failure at night, do not turn on landing light 
above 1,000 feet above terrain in order to preserve battery power.

<p><b><a name="performance info">Performance information</a></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This section should include information concerning 
(1) steady rates of climb and hovering ceilings together with the 
corresponding airspeeds and other pertinent information, including the 
calculated effect of altitude and temperature; (2) maximum wind allowable 
for safe operation near the ground; and (3) sufficient information to 
outline the limiting heights and corresponding speeds for safe landing 
after power failure.

<br><font size=-1>Figure 42.--Rate of climb and best rate of climb
speed chart.</font></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="sample rate of climb">
The</a> chart in figure <a href="chapter_6.html#fig 42">42</a> is an example 
taken from one manual from which rates of climb and best rate of climb 
airspeed can be computed. It can be used to compute the rate of climb for 
various density altitudes. The steps are as follows:

<table width=100%><tr valign=top><td>1.</td><td>
Compute the density altitude for the temperature/pressure altitude 
conditions by using a density altitude chart 
<a href="chapter_8.html#fig 51">(fig. 51)</a>. Some flight manuals contain 
density altitude charts.
</td></tr><tr valign=top><td>2.</td><td>
Locate the resulting density altitude along the left side of the chart 
<a href="chapter_6.html#fig 42">(fig, 42)</a>, move horizontally from this 
point to the diagonal line, then vertically downward to the bottom line 
where the rate of climb in feet per minute is read. For example, if the 
computed density altitude is 1,000 feet, the rate of climb should be 1,250 
feet per minute.
</td></tr><tr valign=top><td>3.</td><td>
The best rate of climb airspeed can be found by moving horizontally from 
the density altitude point to the diagonal line in the chart on the right 
side, then moving vertically downward to the bottom line where the airspeed 
giving the best rate of climb in miles per hour can be read. In the example 
given in 2 above, it is approximately 57 MPH. At a density altitude of 
8,500 feet, the best rate of climb airspeed is approximately 50 MPH and the 
rate of climb is approximately 425 feet per minute. Maximum allowable wind 
for safe operations near the surface will be noted by a statement in most 
flight manuals similar to the following (excerpted from two helicopter 
flight manuals);
</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>
Rearward flight or hovering downwind can be conducted up to 
speeds of 23 MPH IAS. Maximum possible operating wind velocities 
have not been established.
</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><table width=100%><tr><td>&nbsp;</td>
<td align=right>*</td><td align=center>*</td><td align=left>*</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr></table>
</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>
the maximum wind in which crosswind takeoffs and landings and 
tail-into-the-wind hovering is safe is 20 MPH; however, this 
is not to be considered the limiting value for flight as normal 
takeoffs, landings, and other maneuvers made close to the ground 
which do not require turning more than 45 degrees out of the 
wind may be made in much higher winds with the upper limit 
depending on experience and skill of the pilot.
</td></tr></table>
<a name="airspeed vs altitude"></a>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Limiting heights and corresponding speeds for safe 
landing after power failure are generally incorporated in a chart called 
the <a name="alt vs air">Airspeed vs. Altitude Limitations Chart</a>, but  
often referred to as the Height-Velocity Curve or Diagram. This chart 
generally appears in the performance section of the helicopter flight 
manual, but occasionally may be found in the Operating Limitations section.  
Figures <a href="chapter_6.html#fig 43">43</a> and 
<a href="chapter_6.html#fig 44">44</a> represent such charts. These charts 
will be discussed in detail in a latter chapter.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All helicopters will generally have one or more 
placards displayed in conspicuous places that have a direct and important 
bearing on safe operation of the helicopter. These placards will generally 
appear in the helicopter flight manual in the Operating Limitations section 
under the heading of &quot;Placards.&quot; Here are some examples from 
various flight manuals:
