</font></b></center>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the foregoing chapters in this handbook, it 
should be obvious that the variable factors of wind, temperature, humidity, 
gross wieght, structural differences of various helicopter models greatly 
affect the operation of the helicopter. Even when flying the same model 
helicopter, two flights are seldom exactly alike to the pilot because of 
variation in wind and density altitude. Therefore, it is practically 
impossible to prescribe helicopter attitudes for the performance of each 
flight maneuver since this handbook should generally apply to all 
helicopters having the characteristics set forth on page 1. Attitudes, 
airspeeds, altitudes, and power settings will vary to suit the weather, the 
particular helicopter, and the loading. For example, on a day with a 20-
MPH wind and a 1,000-foot density altitude, a certain nose-low attitude 
and power setting will be required to hover and to initiate a departure 
from a hover to commence a normal takeoff; the following day, with a 
no-wind condition and a 2,500-foot density altitude, both the nose attitude 
and the power setting for hovering and initiating a departure from the 
hover may differ considerably in degree from the previous day. Obviously, 
then, it would be impossible for the handbook to outline a specific nose 
attitude and power setting for departure from a hover. Therefore, this 
chapter does not detail each and every attitude of a helicopter in the 
various flight maneuvers, nor each and every move a pilot must make in 
order to perform a given maneuver.

<a name="takeoff to hover">VERTICAL TAKEOFF TO A HOVER</a>
</b></font></center>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vertical takeoff (or takeoff to a hover) is a 
maneuver in which the helicopter is raised vertically from the surface to 
the normal hovering altitude with a minimum of lateral and/or fore and aft 
movement.
<br><br>
<font size="+1"><i>TECHNIQUE:</i><font>
<blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Head the helicopter into the wind, if possible.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Place the cyclic stick in the neutral posistion.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Be sure that the collecive pitch stick is in the 
full down position.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Increase the throttle smoothly to obtain and 
maintain proper hover RPM.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Raise the collective pitch. Use smooth, continuous 
movement, coordinating throttle to maintain proper RPM setting. As 
collective pitch is increased and the helicopter becomes light on the skids, 
torque will tend to cause the nose to swing to the right unless the pilot 
adds a sufficient amount of left pedal to maintain a constant heading.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. As the helicopter becomes light on the skids, make 
necessary cyclic stick corrections to ensure a level attitude (for the 
existing load and wind conditions) on becoming airborne, pedal corrections 
to maintain heading, and collective pitch corrections to ensure continuous 
vertical ascent to normal hovering altitude.
<br><br><center><font size="-1"><b>The higher the density altitude, hovering 
altitude should be lower.</b></font></center>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. When hovering altitude is reached, adjust throttle 
and collective pitch as required to maintain proper RPM and altitude. 
Coordinate pedal changes with throttle and collective changes as necessary 
to maintain a constat position over the spot. Remember-collective pitch 
controls altitude, cyclic pitch controls attitude and position.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Check engine and control operation, manifold 
pressure required to hover, and note cyclic stick position. Cyclic stick 
position will vary with amount and distribution of load and wind velocity.
<br>
</blockquote>
<font size="+1"><i>COMMON ERRORS:</i></font>
<blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Failing to ascend vertically as the helicopter becomes 
airborne.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Pulling through on the collective after becoming 
airborne, causing the helicopter to gain too much altitude. This, in turn, 
necessitates comparatively large throttle and collective pitch changes.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Overcontrolling the pedals, which not only changes 
the heading of the helicopter but also changes RPM, thus necessitating 
constant throttle adjustment.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Reducing throttle rapidly in situations where 
proper RPM has been exceeded, which usually results in violent changes of 
heading to the left and loss of lift resulting in loss of altitude.
</blockquote>
<center><font size="+1"><b>
<a name="hovering">HOVERING</a>
</b></font></center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHovering is a maneuver in which the helicopter is 
maintained in nearly motionless flight over a reference point at a constant 
altitude and on a constant heading. The maneuver requires a high degree of 
concentration and coordination on the part of the pilot. When hovering, a 
pilot holds the helicopter over a selected point by use of cyclic control; 
maintains altitude by use of collective pitch control; and maintains a 
constant heading by use of antitorque pedals. Only by proper coordination 
of all controls can successful flight be achieved.
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspControl corrections should be pressure rather than abrupt 
movements. A constant pressure on the desired will result in a smooth rate 
turn; pronounced movements tend to jerk the nose around. If the helicopter 
tends to move forward, a slight amount of back pressure on the cyclic stick 
will stop the forward movement. Just before the the movement stops, back 
pressure must be released or the helicopter will come to a stop, and start 
into rearward flight. Avoid waiting out helicopter moves; make all 
corrections immediately. Stopping and stabilizing the helicopter at a hover 
requires a number of small corrections to avoid overcontroling.
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe attitude of the helicopter determines its movements 
over the surface. While the attitude required to hover varies with wind 
conditions and center-of-gravity location, there is a particular attitude 
which can be found by experimetation to keep the helicopter hovering over 
a selected point. After this attitude has been determined, deviations can 
be noted and necessary corrections made before the helicopter actually 
starts to move from the point.
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHovering altitude is maintained by use of collective 
pitch, coordinated with the throttle, to maintain a constant RPM. the 
amount of collective pitch needed to maintain hovering altitude varies 
with wind, air density (density altitude), and gross weight. When a steady 
wind is blowing, very little adjustment of the collective pitch stick should 
be required to hold a desired altitude. Only under variable and gusty wind 
conditions should any great collective pitch control changes be required,
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCoordination of all controls cannot be overemphasized. 
Any change on one control will almost always require a coordinated 
correction on one or more of the other controls. Hovering can be 
accomplished in a precision manner only when corrections are small, smooth, 
and coordinated.
<br><br>
<font size="+1"><i>COMMON ERRORS:</i></font>
<blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Tenseness and slow reactions to movements of the 
helicopter.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Failure to allow for lag in cyclic and collective 
pitch control which leads to <br>overcontrolling.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Confusing altitude changes for attitude changes, 
resulting in improper use of controls.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Hovering too high, creating a hazardous flight 
condition.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Hovering too low, resulting in occasional touchdown.
</blockquote>
<center><font size="+1"><b>
<a name="hovering turn">HOVERING TURN</a>
</b></font></center>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hovering turn is a maneuver performed at hovering 
altitude in which the nose of the helicopter is rotated left or right while 
maintaining position over a reference point on the surface. This maneuver 
requires the coordination of all flight control near the surface. Constant 
altitude, rate of turn and RPM should be maintained.
<br><br>
<font size="+1"><i>TECHNIQUE:</i><font>
<blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Initiate the maneuver from a normal hovering altitude 
by applying pedal in the desired direction of turn.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. As the nose begins to turn, and throughout the 
remainder of the turn, use cyclic control to maintain position over the 
surface reference point. Use pedals to maintain a slow, constant rate of 
turn, and use collective pitch, along with proper throttle coordination, 
to maintain a constant altitude and proper operating RPM.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. As the 180&deg; position is approached, anticipate 
the use of a small amount of opposite pedal. As the tail of the helicopter 
swings from a position into into the wind to a position downwind, the 
helicopter will have a tendency to whip or increase its rate of turn as a 
result of weather-vaning tendency of the tail surface. The higher the winds, 
the greater the whipping action.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. As the desired heading on which the turn is to be 
completed is approached, apply opposite pedal as necessary to stop the turn 
on this heading.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. During a hovering turn to the left, the RPM will 
increase if throttle is not reduced slightly. (This is due to the amount of 
engine power that is being absorbed by the tail rotor which is dependent 
upon the pitch angle at which the tail rotor blades are operating.) Avoid 
making large corrections in RPM while turning since the throttle adjustment 
will result in erratic nose movements due to torque changes.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. If you wish to determine the amount of left pedal 
available, make the first hovering turn to the left. If a 90&deg; turn to 
the left cannot be made, or if an unusual amount of pedal is required to 
complete a 45&deg; hovering to the left, do not attempt a turn to the right 
since sufficient left pedal may not be available to prevent an uncontrolled 
turn. Hovering power requires a large amount of left pedal to maintain 
heading. Sufficient left pedal in <i>excess of this amount</i> must be 
available to prevent an uncontrolled turn to the right once the turn has 
begun.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Hovering turns should be avoided in winds strong 
enough to preclude sufficient aft cyclic control to maintain the helicopter 
on the selected surface reference point when headed downwind. Check the 
helicopter flight manual for the manufacturer's recommendations for this 
limitation.

<font size="+1"><i>COMMON ERRORS:</i></font>
<blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Failing to maintain a slow, constant rate of turn.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Failing to maintain position over the reference 
point.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Failing to keep the RPM within normal operating 
range.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forward hovering flight can generally be used to move 
the helicopter to a specific area unless strong winds prohibit crosswind 
or downwind hovering. A hovering turn is utilized to head the helicopter in 
the direction of the desired area, the forward flight at a slow speed is 
used move to the area. During the maneuver, constant groundspeed, altitude, 
and heading should be maintained.

front of the helicopter and in line with it. These reference points should 
be kept in line throughout the maneuver <a href="Chapter_11.html#fig 69">
(fig. 69)</a>.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Begin the maneuver from a normal hovering altitude 
by applying forward pressure on the cyclic stick.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. As movement begins, return the cyclic stick toward 
the neutral position to keep the groundspeed at a low rate-no faster than 
normal walking speed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Throughout the maneuver, maintain a constant 
groundspeed and ground track with cyclic stick, a constant altitude with 
collective pitch control, and proper operating RPM with throttle.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. To stop the forward movement, apply rearward cyclic 
pressure until the helicopter stops. As forward motion stops, the cyclic 
must be returned to the neutral position to prevent rearward movement. 
Forward movement can also be stopped by simply applying enough rearward 
cyclic pressure to level the helicopter and let it drift to a stop.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sideward hovering flight may be necessary to move the 
helicopter to a specific area when conditions make it impossible to use 
foreward flight. During the maneuver, a constant groundspeed, altitude, and 
heading should be maintained.
<br><br>
<font size="+1"><i>TECHNIQUE:</i><font>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Before starting sideward flight, pick out two reference 
points in a line in the direction flight is to be made to help you maintain 
proper ground track <a href="Chapter_11.html#fig 68">(fig. 68)</a>. These 
reference points should be kept in line throughout the maneuver.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Begin the maneuver from a normal hovering altitude 
by applying cyclic toward the side in movement is desired.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. As movement begins, return the cyclic stick toward 
the neutral position to keep the groundspeed at a slow rate-no faster than 
normal walking speed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Throughout the maneuver, maintan a constant 
groundspeed and ground track with cyclic stick, a constant heading 
(perpendicular to the proposed ground track) with pedals, a constant 
altitude with collective pitch control, and proper operating RPM with 
throttle.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. To stop the sideward movement, apply cyclic 
pressure in the direction opposite that of movement, and hold it until the 
helicopter stops. As motion stops the cyclic must be retuned to the neutral 
position to prevent movement in the opposite direction. Sideward movement 
also can be stopped by simply applying enough opposite cyclic pressure to 
level the helicopter. Then it will drift to a stop.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Takeoff from a hover is an orderly transition to 
forward flight and is executed to increase altitude safely and expeditiously.
<br><br>
<font size="+1"><i>TECHNIQUE:</i><font>
<blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Bring the helicopter to a hover. Check engine and 
control operation. Note the cyclic stick position to determine if the 
aircraft is loaded properly. Check the manifold pressure required to hover 
to determine the amount of excess power available.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Visually clear the area all around.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Smoothly and slowly ease the cyclic stick forward. 
Apply just enough forward cyclic pressure to start the helicopter moving 
forward over the surface <a href="Chapter_11.html#fig 70">(fig. 70)</a>.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. As the helicopter starts to move forward, 
increase collective pitch as necessary to prevent decending, and adjust 
throttle to maintain RPM. The increase in power will require an increase 
in left pedal to maintain heading. A straight takeoff path should be 
maintained throughout the takeoff.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. As you accelerate to effective translational lift, 
the helicopter will begin to climb and the nose will tend to rise due to 
increased lift. At this point adjust collective pitch to obtain normal 
climb power and apply enough forward cyclic stick to overcome the tendency 
of the nose to rise. Hold an attitude that will allow a smooth acceleration 
toward climbing airspeed and a commensurate gain in altitude so that the 
takeoff profile will not take you through any of the crosshatched area of 
the height-velocity chart for the particular helicopter being flown. As 
airspeed is increased, the streamlining of the fuselage reduces engine 
torque effect, requiring a gradual reduction of left pedal.

approaches normal climb speed, apply aft cyclic stick pressure to raise 
the nose smoothly to normal climb attitude.

<b>
<a name="crosswind takeoff">Crosswind considerations during takeoffs</a>
</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a takeoff is made during crosswind conditions, the 
helicopter is flown in a <a href="Chapter_11.html#slips">slip</a> during the 
early stages of the maneuver. The cyclic pitch is held into the wind a 
sufficient amount to maintain the selected ground track for the takeoff, and 
the heading is kept straight along the takeoff path using the antitorque 
pedals <a href="Chapter_11.html#fig 71">(fig. 71)</a>. Thus, the ground 
track and fuselage are aligned with each other. In other words, the rotor is 
tilted into the wind so that the sideward movement of the helicopter is just 
enough to counteract the wind drift. To prevent the nose from turning in the 
direction of rotor tilt, it will be necessary to increase pedal pressure on 
the side opposite to rotor tilt. The stronger the crosswind component, the 
greater the amount of opposite pedal pressure required to maintain heading.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After approximately 50 feet of altitude is gained, a 
heading (crab) into the wind <a href="Chapter_11.html#fig 71">(fig. 71)</a> 
should be established by a coordinated turn to maintain the desired ground 
track. The stronger the crosswind component, the more the helicopter will 
have to be turned into the wind to maintain the desired ground track. Once 
straight-and-level flight on the desired heading is obtained, the pedals 
should continue to be used as necessary to compensate for torque to keep the 
helicopter in longitudinal trim.

<a name="straight-and-level">STRAIGHT-AND-LEVEL FLIGHT</a>
</b></font></center>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straight-and-level flight in which a constant 
attitude and heading are maintained. (The straight-and-level flight 
attitude is the attitude of the helicopter necessary to maintain straight-
and-level flight. The level-flight attitude is the attitude of the 
helicopter necessary to maintain altitude. These terms used throughout this 
handbook.)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The airspeed is determined by the attitude of the 
helicopter. The attitude of the helicopter is controlled by the movement 
of the cyclic control stick; altitude is primarily maintained by use of the 
collective pitch. To maintain forward flight, the rotor tip-path plane 
must be tilted forward to obtain the necessary horizontal thrust component 
from the main rotor. This will generally result in a nose - low attitude. 
The lower the nose, the greater the power required to maintain altitude 
(and the higher the resulting speed). Conversely, the greater the power 
used, the lower nose must be to maintain altitude.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When in straight-and-level flight, an increase in 
collective pitch while holding airspeed constant with the cyclic control 
causes the helicopter to climb; a decrease in collective pitch while holding 
airspeed constant causes a descent. A correction on the collective pitch 
control requires coordinated correction on the throttle control in order to 
maintain a constant RPM, and on the antitorque pedals to maintain heading 
and to keep the helicopter in longitudinal trim. Coordinated flight should 
be maintained (that is, neither slipping nor skidding).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To increase airspeed in straight-and-level flight, 
apply forward pressure on the cyclic control stick and raise the collective 
pitch as necessary to maintain altitude. To decrease airspeed, apply aft 
pressure on the cyclic control stick and lower the collective pitch as 
necessary to maintain altitude.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although cyclic pitch control is sensitive, there is a 
slight delay in control reaction and it will be necessary to anticipate 
actual movement of the helicopter. In making cyclic corrections to control 
the attitude or airspeed of a helicopter, care should be taken not to 
overcontrol. If the nose of the helicopter rises above the level-flight 
attitude, forward pressure is applied to the cyclic stick to bring the nose 
down. If this correction is held to long the nose will drop too low. Since 
the helicopter will continue to change attitude momentarily after the 
controls reach neutral, return the cyclic stick control to neutral slighly 
before the desired attitude is reached. This principle holds true for any 
cyclic pitch control correction.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The helicopter is inherently unstable. If gusts or 
turbulence cause the nose to drop, it will tend to continue dropping 
instead of returning to a straight-and-level attitude as would a 
fixed-wing aircraft. A pilot must remain alert and FLY the helicopter at 
all times.

<a name="turns">TURNS</a>
</b></font></center>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A turn is a mameuver used to change the heading of the 
helicopter. the aerodynamics of a turn have been discussed previously-lift 
components, loss of vertical lift, and load factors-and should be 
throughly understood.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before beginning any turn, the area in the direction 
of the turn should be carefully cleared above, below, and at the flight 
level. To enter a turn from straight-and-level flight, apply sideward 
on the cyclic stick in the direction the turn is to be made. This is the 
control movement necessary to start the turn. Do not use the pedals to 
assist the turn. The pedals should be used to compensate for torque to keep 
the helicopter in longitudinal trim. The more the cyclic stick is displaced, 
the steeper the angle of bank; therefore, adjust the cyclic and maintain the 
desired bank throughout the turn. Increase collective pitch and throttle as 
necessary to maintain altitude and RPM, and increase left pedal pressure to 
counteract the added torque effect and to maintain longitudinal trim. 
Depending on degree of bank, additional forward cyclic pressure may be 
required to maintain airspeed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recovery from the turn is the same as the entry except 
that pressure on the cyclic stick is applied in the opposite direction. 
Since the helicopter will continue to turn as long as there is any bank, 
start the rollout before reaching the desired heading.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a name="climb or desend"></a>
The discussion on level turns is equally applicable to 
making turns while climbimg or descending, the only difference being that 
the helicopter will be in a climbing or descending attitude rather than the 
level flight attitude. If a simultaneous entry is desired, merely combine 
the techniques of both maneuvers-climb or descent entry and turn entry.
<br><br>
<b><a name="skids">Skids</a></b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A skid occurs when the helicopter slides sideways away 
from the center of the the turn. It is caused by too much pedal pressure in 
the direction of turn, or by too little in the direction opposite the turn 
in relation to the amount of collective stick (power) used. If the 
helicopter is forced to turn faster with increased pedal pressure instead of 
by increasing the degree of bank, it will skid sideways away from the center 
of turn. Instead of flying in its normal curved pattern, it will fly a 
straighter course.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a right climbing turn, if insufficient left pedal 
is applied to compensate for increased torque effect, a skid will occur. In 
a left climbing turn, if excessive left pedal is applied to compensate for 
increased torque effect, a skid will occur.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a right descending turn, if excessive right pedal 
is applied to compensate for decreased torque, a skid will occur. In a left 
descending turn, if insufficient right pedal is applied to compensate for 
the decreased torque effect, a skid will occur.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A skid may also occur when flying straight-and-level 
if the nose of the helicopter is allowed to move sudeways along the horizon. 
This condition occurs when improper pedal pressure is held to counteract 
torque and the helicopter is held level with cyclic control.
<br><br>
<b><a name="slips">Slips</a></b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A slip occurs when the helicopter slides sideways 
toward the center of the turn. It is caused by an insufficient amount of 
pedal in the direction of turn (or too much in the direction opposite the 
turn) in relation to the amount of collective stick (power) used. In other 
words, if improper pedal pressure is held, keeping the nose from following 
the turn, the helicopter will slip sideways toward the center of turn.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a right climbing turn, if excessive left pedal is 
applied to compensate for the increased torque effect, a slip will occur. In 
a left climbing turn, if insufficient left pedal is applied to compensate 
for the increased torque effect, a slip will occur.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a right descending turn, if insufficient right 
pedal is applied to compensate for the decreased torque effect, a slip will 
occur. In a left descendind turn, if excessive right pedal is applied to 
compensate for the decreased torque effect, a slip will occur.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A slip may also occur in straight-and-level flight if 
one side of the helicopter is low and the nose is held straight by pedal 
pressure. This is the technique used in correcting for a crosswind during an 
approach and during a takeoff when at a low altitude.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summarizing then, a skid occurs when the rate of turn 
is too fast for the amount of bank being used; a slip occurs when the rate 
of turn is too slow for slow for the amount of bank being used.

<a name="approachs">APPROACHES</a>
</b></font></center>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An approach is a transition maneuver in which the 
helicopter is flown from traffic pattern altitude to a hover at normal 
hovering altitude and with zero groundspeed. It is basically a power glide 
made at an angle of descent corresponding to the type of approach that is 
made.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A helicopter pilot should be proficient in performing 
three basic types of approaches--normal, steep, and shallow--and should 
know to analyze influential outside factors, and know how to plan an 
approach to fit any particular situation. Choice of approach is governed by 
the size of the landing area, barriers in the approach path, type of 
surface, temperature, altitude, density altitude, wind direction, wind speed 
and gross weight.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All approaches should be regarded as precision 
approaches and should be made to a predetermined point. Rate of decent and 
airspeed are indepedently controlled by the pilot. Therefore, little 
tolerance should be given to overshooting a chosen landing spot, To maintain 
a maximum margin of safety in each type of approach, effective translational 
lift should be retained as long as practicable.
<br><br>
<b>Factors to consider when making approaches</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation of existing wind coditions must be made 
before starting an approach. Although the approach is generally made into 
the wind, conditions may indicate that entry will have to be made from a 
downwind or crosswind position. The traffic pattern is generally flown at 
normal or nearly normal airspeed. The velocity of the wind determines the 
airspeed that will be maintained after the approach in initiated. Airspeed 
should be increased in proportion to any increased wind velocity. Angle of 
descent should remain constant, regardless of wind velocity.
<a name="crosswind approach"></a>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crosswind approaches are made by crabbing or slipping, 
or by a combination of both. To make running landings in strong crosswinds, 
it may be necessary to touch down initially with the windward (upwind) skid 
to avoid drifting.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RPM should remain constant during all approaches. If 
RPM is allowed to fluctuate or change abruptly, variations of torque forces 
will cause the fuselage to yaw around the vertical axis and control will be 
difficult. To maintain proper directional control, changes in RPM and/or 
collective pitch setting must be made smoothly and must be accompanied by 
appropriate changes in antitorque pedals.

<a name="normal approach to hover">NORMAL APPROACH TO A HOVER</a>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A normal approach to a hover is basiclly a power glide

<blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The entry to the downwind leg should be made at a 
45&deg; angle to the downwind leg so that the actual turn to the downwind 
leg will be accomplished opposite the middle one-third of the runway. The 
transition from downwind leg to the final approach led may be made by two 
90&deg; turns in which a defnite base leg is established, or by a 180&deg; 
turn. At all times during this transition, sufficient altitude should be 
available so that in case of engine failure, an autorotative landing can be 
completed into the wind. The point in the traffic pattern at which the power 
reduction is made should be determined by this fact.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Initiate the approach by lowering the collective 
pitch control the amount required to descend at an angle of approximately 
10&deg; on the final approach leg. As collective pitch is lowered, increase 
right pedal as necessary to compensate for the change in torque reaction to 
maintain heading, and adjust throttle to maintain proper RPM. Decelerate to 
the approximate airspeed, then further adjust attitude as necessary to 
maintain approach airspeed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The angle of descent is primarily controlled by 
collective pitch, the airspeed is primarily controlled by the cyclic 
control, and heading on final approach is maintained with pedal control. 
However, only by the coordination of all controls can the approach be 
accomplished successfully.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The approach airspeed should be maintained until 
the point on the approach is reached where, through evaluation of apparent 
groundspeed, it is determined that forward airspeed must be progressessively 
decreased in order to arrive at hovering altitude and attitude at the 
intended landing spot with zero groundspeed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. As forward airspeed is gradually reduced by the 
application of rearward cyclic, additional power (collective pitch) must be 
applied to compensate for the decrease in translational lift and to maintain 
the proper angle of descent. As collective pitch is increased, the left 
pedal must be increased to maintain heading, throttle adjusted to maintain 
RPM, and cyclic pitch coordinated to maintain the proper rate of closure to 
the desired spot (a continual decrease in groundspeed).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. The approach is terminated at hovering altitude 
above the intended landing point with zero groundspeed. If power has been 
properly applied during the final portion of the approach, very little 
additional power should be required during the termination.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. If the condition of the landing spot is unknown, 
the approach may be terminated just short of the spot so that it can be 
checked before moving forward for the landing.

<blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Entry is made in the same way as for a normal approach, 
except that a  greater reduction of collective pitch is usually required at 
the beginning of the approach to start the descent than for a normal 
approach. As collective pitch is lowered, increase right pedal to maintain 
heading and adjust throttle to maintain RPM.

primarily controlled by collective pitch, and the speed is primarily 
controlled by the cyclic control. However, only by the coordination of all 
controls can the approach be accomplished successfully.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The approach airspeed should be maintained until 
the point on the approach is reached where, through evaluation of apparent 
groundspeed, it is determined that forward airspeed must be progressively 
decreased in order to arrive at hovering altitude at intended landing spot 
with zero groundspeed. This is very important since a flare should not be 
made near the surface due to the danger of tail rotor strikes.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. As forward airspeed is gradually reduced by the 
application of rearward cyclic pressure, additional power (collective pitch) 
must be applied to compensate for the decrease in translational lift and to 
maintain proper angle of descent. As collective pitch is increased, left 
pedal must be increased to maintain heading, throttle adjusted to maintain 
RPM, and cyclic pitch coordinated to maintain the proper change in forward 
airspeed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Since the angle of descent on a steep approach is 
much steeper than for a normal approach, the collective pitch must be used 
much sooner at the bottom of the approach. The approach is terminated at 
hovering altitude above the intended landing point with zero groundspeed. 
If power has been properly applied during the final portion of the approach, 
very little additional power should be required during the termination.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbspA shallow approach and running landing <a href=

or a high gross weight condition or some combination thereof is such that a

shallow approach, a surface area of sufficient length and smoothness must 
be available.

<blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. A shallow approach is initiated in the same manner as a 
normal approach except that a shallower angle of descent is maintained. The 
power reduction to initiate the desired angle of descent will be less. As 
collective pitch is lowered, maintain heading by increasing right pedal 
pressure, adjust throttle to maintain RPM, and use cyclic as necessary to 
maintain the desired approach airspeed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. As in normal and steep approaches, the angle of 
descent and rate of descent are primarily controlled by collective pitch, 
and the groundspeed is primarily controlled by the cyclic control. The 
coordination of all controls is needed, however, if the approach is to be 
accomplished successfully.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Approach airspeed should be maintained until an 
altitude of approximately 50 feet above the surface has been reached. At 
this point, gradually apply aft cyclic stick to start dissipating airspeed 
and coordinate a slight downward pressure on collective pitch to maintain 
the angle of descent. The deceleration of the airspeed should be enough so 
that the helicopter will tend to descend to the surface due to the decreased 
effect of translational lift just as the landing spot is reached. Since 
translational lift diminishs rapidly at slow airspeeds, the deceleration 
must be smoothly coordinated, at the same time keeping enough lift to 
prevent the helicopter from settling abruptly.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. On the final part of the approach, prior to making 
surface contact, the helicopter should be placed in a level attitude with 
cyclic control, pedals should be used as necessary so that the helicopter 
and ground track are identical. Allow the helicopter to descend gently to 
the surface in a straight-and-level attitude, cushioning the landing by 
proper manipulation of the collective pitch.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. After surface contact, the cyclic control should 
be placed slightly forward of neutral to tilt the main rotor away from the 
tail boom; antitorque pedals should be used to maintain heading; throttle 
should be used to maintain RPM; and cyclic stick should be used to maintain 
surface track. Normally, the collective pitch is held stationary after 
touchdown until the helicopter comes to a complete stop. However, if 
braking action is desired or required, the collective pitch may be lowered 
cautiously. To ensure directioal control, normal rotor RPM must be 
maintained until the helicopter stops.

prevent a sustained hover at normal hovering altitude. It is often referred

momentarily or at a very low altitude, a running takeoff is not advisable. 
No takeoff should be attempted if the helicopter cannot be lifted off the 
surface momentarily at full power because:

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1--If the helicopter cannot be hovered, its 
performance is unpredictable.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2--If the helicopter cannot be raised off the surface 
at all, sufficient power might not be available for a safe running takeoff.

</b></font></center>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A maximum performance take off is used to climb at a 
steep angle to clear barriers in the flightpath 
<a href="Chapter_11.html#fig 76">(fig. 76).</a> It can be used when taking 
off from small fields surrounded by high obstacles. Before attempting a 
maximum performance takeoff, you must know thoroughly the capabilites and 
limitations of your equipment. You must take into consideration the wind 
velocity, temperature, altitude, density altitude, gross weight, 
center-of-gravity location,and other factors affecting your technique and 
the performance of the helicopter. To safely accomplish this type of 
takeoff, sufficient power to hover must be available to prevent the 
helicopter from sinking back to the surface after becoming airborne. This 
maneuver will result in a steep climb, affording maximum altitude gain in a 
minimum distance forward.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The angle of climb for a maximum performance takeoff 
will depend on existing conditions. The more critial the conditions--high 
densinty altitude,calm winds, ect.--the shallower the angle of climb should 
be. Use caution in climbing steeply. If the airspeed is allowed to get too 
low, the helicopter may settle back to the surface. The height-velocity 
(H/V) chart for the particular helicopter should be fully considered 
before making any maximum performance takeoff. An engine failure at low 
altitude and airspeed would place the helicopter in a dangerous position, 
requiring a high degree of skill in making a autorotative landing. It may 
be necessary to operate in the shaded area of the H/V diagram during the 
beginning of this maneuver when operating in light or no-wind conditions. 
The angle of climb and resultig airspeed will be dictated by the proximity 
and height of the obstacles to be cleared. The pilot must be aware of the 
calculated risk involved when operating in the shaded area of the H/V 
diagram.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Establish the proper RPM setting and apply 
sufficient collective pitch to lighten the helicopter on its landing gear 
<a href="Chapter_11.html#fig 76">(fig. 76)</a>. Apply the maximum amount of 
collective pitch that can be obtained without reducing RPM and 
simultaneously add full throttle (maximum pitch and full throttle may be 
impractial or at least unnecessary on some helicopters, particulary on those 
equipped with supercharged engines) and sufficient forward cyclic stick to 
establish a forward climbing attitude as the helicopter leaves the surface. 
Apply necessary antitorque pedal control to maintain heading. RPM must not 
be sacrificed to obtain increased pitch on the rotor blades. If RPM starts 
to decrease under full power condition, it can be regained only br reducing 
collective pitch.

<a name="autorotations">AUTOROTATIONS</a>
</b></font></center>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In helicopter flying, an autorotation is a maneuver 
that can be performed by the pilot whenever the engine is no longer 
supplying power to the main rotor blades. A helicopter transmission is 
designed to allow the main rotor to rotate freely in its original direction 
if the engine stops. At the instant of engine failure, the blades will be 
producing lift and thrust from their angle of attack and velocity. By 
immediately lowering collective pitch (which must be done in case of engine 
failure), lift and drag will be reduced, and the helicopter will begin an 
immediate descent, thus producing an upward flow of air through the rotor 
system. The impact of this upward flow of air on the rotor blades produces a 
"ram" effect which provides sufficient thrust to maintain rotor RPM 
throughout the descent. Since the tail rotor is driven by the main rotor 
during autorotation, heading control can be maintained as in normal flight.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several factors affect the rate of descent in 
autorotation--air density (density altitude), gross weight, rotor RPM, and 
airspeed. The pilot's primary control of the rate of descent is the 
airspeed. Higher or lower airspeed is obtained with the cyclic control just 
as in normal flight. A pilot has a choice in angle of descent varying from 
vertical descent to maximum range (minimum angle of descent). Rate of 
descent is high at zero airspeed and decreases to a minimum somewhere in the 
neighborhood of 50 to 60 miles per hour, depending upon the particular 
helicopter and the factors just mentioned. As the airspeed increases beyond 
that which gives minimum rate of descent, the descent increases again. When 
an autorotative landing is to be made, the energy stored in the rotating 
blades can be used by the pilot to decrease the rate of descent and make a 
safe landing. A greater amount of rotor energy is required to stop a 
helicopter with a high rate of descent than is required to stop a helicopter 
that is descending more slowly. It follows then that autorotative descents 
at very low or very high airspeeds are more critical than those performed at 
proper airspeed for the minimum rate of descent.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each type of helicopter has a specific airspeed at 
which a power-off glide is most efficient. The best airspeed is the one 
which combines the most desirable (greatest) glide range with the most 
desirable (slowest) rate of descent. The specific airspeed is somewhat 
different for each type of helicopter, yet certain factors affect all 
configurations in the same manner. For specific autorotation airspeeds for 
a particular helicopter refer to the helicopter flight manual.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The specific airspeed for autorotations is established 
for each type of helicopter on the basis of average weather and wind 
conditions, and normal loading. When the helicopter is operated with 
excessive loads in high density altitude or strong gusty wind conditions, 
best performance is achieved from a slightly increased airspeed in the 
descent. For autorotations in light winds, low density altitude, and light 
loading, best performance is achieved from a slight decrease in normal 
airspeed. Following this general procedure of fitting airspeed to existing 
conditions, a pilot can achieve approximately the same glide angle in any 
set of circumstances and estimate the touchdown point.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When making turns during an autorotative descent, 
generally use cyclic control only. Use of antitorque pedals to assist or 
speed the turn causes loss of airspeed and downward pitching of the 
nose--especially when left pedal is used. When the autorotation is 
initiated, sufficient right pedal pressure should be used to maintain 
straight flight and prevent yawing to the left. This pressure should not be 
changed to assist the turn.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If rotor RPM becomes too high during an autorotative 
approach, collective pitch should be raised sufficiently to decrease RPM to 
the normal operating range, then lowered all the way again. This procedure 
may be repeated as necessary.
<blockquote><font size="-1"><b>
If the throttle has not been closed in practice autorotations, it will be 
necessary to reduce it as collective pitch is raised; otherwise the engine 
and rotor will reengage. After the collective is lowered, the throttle 
should be readjusted to maintain a safe engine RPM.
</b></font></blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RPM is most likely to increase above the maximum limit 
during a turn due to the increased back cyclic stick pressure which induces 
a greater airflow through the rotor system. The tighter the turn and the 
heavier the gross wieght, the higher the RPM will be.

<a name="hover autorotation">HOVERING AUTOROTATION</a>
</b></font></center>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the name implies, hovering autorotations are made 
from a hover. They are practiced so that a pilot will automatically make the 
correct response when confronted with engine stoppage or certain other 
in-flight emergencies while hovering.
<br><br>
<font size="+1"><i>TECHNIQUE:</i><font>
<blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. To practice hovering autorotations, establish a normal 
hovering altitude for the particular helicopter being used, considering its 
load and the atmospheric conditions, and keep the helicopter headed into the 
wind. Hold maximum allowable RPM.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. To enter autorotation, close the throttle quickly 
to ensure a clean split of the needles. This disengages the driving force of 
the engine from the rotor, thus eliminating torque effect. As the throttle 
is closed, right pedal must be applied to maintain heading. Usually, a 
slight amount of right cyclic stick will be necessary to keep the helicoper 
from drifting to the left, but use cyclic control as required to ensure a 
vertical descent and a level attitude. Leave the collective pitch where it 
is on entry.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. In helicopters with low inertia rotor systems, the 
aircraft will begin to settle immediately. Keep a level attitude and ensure 
a vertical descent with cyclic control, heading with pedals, and apply 
upward collective pitch as necessary (generally the full amount is required) 
to slow the descent and cushion the landing. As upward collective pitch is 
applied, the throttle will have to be held in the closed position to prevent 
the rotor from re-engaging.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. In helicopters with high inertia rotor systems, the 
aircraft will maintain altitude momentarily after the throttle is closed. 
Then, as the rotor RPM decreases, the helicopter will start to settle. As it 
settles, apply upward collective pitch (while holding the throttle in the 
closed position) to slow the descent and cushion the landing. The timing of 
this collective pitch applicatin, and the rate at which it should be 
applied, will depend upon the particular helicopter being used, its gross 
weight, and the existing atmospheric conditions. Cyclic control is used to 
maintain a level attitude and to ensure a vertical descent. Heading is 
maintained with pedals.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5: When the weight of the helicopter is entirely on 
the skids, the application of upward collective pitch should cease. When the 
helicopter has come to a complete stop, lower the collective pitch to the 
full down position.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. The timing of the collective pitch is a most 
important consideration. If it is applied too soon, the remaining RPM may 
not be sufficient to make a smooth landing. On the other hand, if collective 
pitch is applied too late, surface contact may be made before sufficient 
blade pitch is available to cushion the landing.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. When entering the autorotation, the throttle should 
be rotated to the closed or override position to prevent the engine from 
re-engaging during the collective pitch application.

</b></font></center>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A no-flare autorotation can be used when the selected 
landing area is sufficiently long and smooth to permit a surface run. 
Practice no-flare autororotations may be made as follows.
<br><br>
<font size="+1"><i>TECHNIQUE:</i><font>
<blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. When the desired position to begin the autorotation has 
been reached, place the collective pitch stick in the full-down position, 
maintaining cruising RPM with throttle. Decrease throttle to ensure a clean 
split of the needles and apply sufficient right pedal to maintain the 
desired heading. After splitting the needles, readjust the throttle so as to 
keep engine RPM well above normal idling speed but not high enough to cause 
rejoining of the needles. (The manufacturer will often recommend the RPM to 
use.)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Ajust attitude with cyclic control to obtain the 
best gliding speed (slowest rate of desent). Be sure to hold collective 
pitch in the full-down position. If is permitted to rise, rotor RPM will 
decrease due to the increased drag from the increased pitch angle of the 
blades. At approximately 50 feet above the surface (check the manufacturer's 
recommendation for each helicopter), raise the nose slightly to obtain the 
desired landing speed and to slow the rate of descent.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. If a landing is to be made from the autorotative 
approach, the throttle should be rotated to the closed or override position 
at this time and held in this position as collective pitch is raised so that 
the rotor will not re-engage. As the helicopter approaches normal hovering 
altitude, maintain a landing attitude with cyclic control, maintain heading 
with pedals, apply sufficient collective pitch (while holding the throttle 
in the closed position) to cushion the touchdown, and be sure the helicopter 
is landing parallel to its direction of motion upon contact with the 
surface. Avoid landing on the heels of the skid gear. The timing of the 
collective pitch application and the amount applied will be dependent on the 
rate of descent.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. After surface contact is made, collective pitch may 
be increased (while holding the throttle in the closed position) to keep the 
helicopter light on the skids and allow it to slow down gradually; or it may 
be held stationary resulting in a shorter ground run; or it may be lowered 
cautiously for additional bracking action, if required, due to a fast 
touchdown and limited landing area. Cyclic control stick should be held 
slightly forward of neutral and used to maintain groundtrack if landing is 
made in a crosswind. Pedals should be used to maintain heading. In the event 
insufficient pedal is available to maintain heading control as the rotor RPM 
decreases after touchdown, cyclic control should be applied in the direction 
of the turn.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. After the helicopter has stopped, lower the 
collective pitch to the full-down position.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. If a power recovery is to be made from practice 
autorotative approaches, the procedures in (3), (4), and (5) should be 
replaced with the procedures given under

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A flare autorotation <a href="Chapter_11.html#fig 77">
(fig. 77)</a> enables the pilot to land a helicopter at any speed between 
that resulting in little or no landing run, up to that of a no-flare 
autorotation; that is, anywhere between a zero groundspeed and the speed of 
touchdown resulting from a no-flare autorotation. The speed at touchdown and 
the resulting ground run will depend on the rate and amount of the 
flare--the greater the degree of flare and the longer it is held, the slower 
the touchdown speed and the shorter the ground run. The slower the speed 
desired at touchdown, the more accurate must be the timing and speed of the 
flare, especially in helicopters with low inertia rotor systems.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Enter the autorotation in the same manner as the 
no-flare autorotation. The technique is the same to the point at where the 
flare is to begin. This point is slightly lower than the point at which the 
nose is in the no-flare autorotation.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. At approximately 35 to 60 feet above the surface, 
depending on the helicopter (check the manufacturer's recommendation), 
initate the flare by moving the cyclic stick to the rear. Heading is 
maitained by the pedals. Care must be taken in the execution of the flare so 
that the cyclic control is not moved rearward so abruptly as to cause the 
helicopter to climb, nor should it be moved so slowly as to allow the 
helicopter to settle so rapidly that the tail rotor might strike the 
surface. As forward motion decreases to the desired groundspeed, move the 
cyclic control forward to place the helicopter in preparation for landing 
attitude. (If a landing is to be made, the throttle should be rotated to the 
closed or override position at this time; if a power recovery is to be made, 
it should be made as the helicopter reaches the landing attitude.)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The altitude at this time should be approximately 
3 to 10 feet, depending upon helicopter being used. If a landing is to be 
made, allow the helicopter to descend vertically. Apply collective pitch, as 
necessary, to check the descent and cushion the landing. As collective pitch 
is increased, hold the throttle in the closed position so the rotor will not 
re-engage. Additional right pedal is required to maintain heading as 
collective pitch is raised due to reduction in rotor RPM and resulting 
reduced effect of the tail rotor.

too much, an engine overspeed will occur; if throttle is increased too

loss of rotor RPM will result. Use sufficient collective pitch to check the 
descent and coordinate left pedal pressure with the increase in collective

especially at the point where the pitch attitude is highest. The altitude at 
completion should be no higher than the maximum safe hovering altitude 
prescribed by the manufacturer. In selecting an altitude at which to begin

helicopter can be brought to a hover during the recovery.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The deceleration is initiated by applying aft 
cyclic to reduce forward speed. Simultaneously, the collective pitch should 
be lowered as necessary to counteract any climbing tendency. The timing must 
be exact. If too little down collective is applied for the amount of aft 
cyclic applied, a climb will result. If too much down collective is 
applied for the amount of aft cyclic applied, a descent will result. A rapid 
application of aft cyclic requires an equally rapid application of down 
collective. As collective pitch is lowered, right pedal should be increased 
to maintain heading and throttle should be adjusted to maintain RPM.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approach to a slope is similar to the approach to 
any other landing area. During slope operations, allowance must be made for 
wind, barriers, and forced landing sites in case of engine failure. Since 
the slope may constitute an obstruction to wind passage, turbulence and 
downdrafts must be anticipated.
<br><br>
<b><a name="slope landing">Slope landing</a></b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Usually, a helicopter should be landed on a 
cross-slope rather than on an upslope. Landing downslope or downhill is not 
recommended because of the possibility of striking the tail rotor on the 
surface.
<br><br>
<font size="+1"><i>TECHNIQUE:</i><font>
<blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. At the termination of the approach, move slowly toward 
the slope, being careful not to turn the tail upslope. The helicopter should 
be hovered in position cross-slope over the spot of intended landing <a 
href="Chapter_11.html#fig 79">(fig. 79)</a>.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. A downward pressure on the collective pitch will 
start the helicopter decending. As the upslope skid touches the ground, 
apply cyclic stick in the direction of the slope. This will hold the skid 
against the slope while the downslope skid is continuing to be let down with 
the collective pitch.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. As collective pitch is lowered, continue to move 
the cyclic stick toward the slope to maintain a fixed position, and use the 
cyclic as necessary to stop forward or aft movement of the helicopter. The 
slope must be shallow enough to allow the pilot to hold the helicopter 
against it with the cyclic stick during the entire landing. (A slope of 
5&deg; is considered maximum for normal operation of most helicopters. Each 
make of helicopter will generally have its own peculiar way of indicating to 
the pilot when lateral cyclic stick travel is about to run out; ie, the 
rotor hub hitting the rotor mast, vibrations felt through the cyclic stick, 
and others. A landing should not be made in these instances since this 
indicates to the pilot that the slope is too steep.)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. After the downslope skid is on the surface, 
continue to lower the collective pitch full down. Normal operating RPM 
should be maintained until the full weight of the helicopter is on the 
skids. This will assure adequate RPM for immediate takeoff in case the 
helicopter should start to slide down the slope. Pedals should be used as 
necessary throughout the landing to maintain heading. Before reducing RPM, 
move the cyclic stick as necessary to check the security of the helicopter.

becomes light on the skids, apply pedal as needed to maintain heading.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. As the downslope skid is rising and the helicopter 
approaches a level attitude, move the cyclic stick back to the neutral 
position, keeping the rotor disk parallel to the true horizon. Continue to 
apply up-collective pitch and take the helicopter straight up to a hover 
before moving away from the slope. In moving away from the slope, the tail 
should not be turned upslope because of the danger of the tail rotor 
striking the surface.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Failure to adjust cyclic stick to keep the helicopter

<a name="low rotor rpm">RECOVERY FROM LOW ROTOR RPM</a>
</b></font></center>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recovery from low rotor RPM is a procedure used to 
return to the normal rotor operating RPM. This recovery procedure, if 
performed properly, will normally regain lost rotor RPM while still 
maintaining flight. A low rotor RPM condition is the result of having an 
angle of attack on the main rotor blades (induced by too much upward 
collective pitch) that has created a drag so great that engine power 
available, or being utilized, is not sufficient to maintain normal rotor 
operating RPM.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a low rotor RPM condition is realized, 
immediately lower the collective pitch. This action will decrease the angle 
of attack of the main rotor blades which, because of reduced rotor drag, 
will momentarily relieve excessive engine load. This action will also cause 
the helicopter to settle because some lift will be lost. As the helicopter 
begins to settle, smoothly raise the collective pitch just enough to stop 
the settling motion. This procedure, under critical conditions, may have to 
be repeated to regain normal rotor RPM or, if terrain permits, a landing may 
be necessary to restore the RPM. When operating at sufficient altitudes 
above the surface, however, it may be necessary to lower the collective 
pitch only once to regain sufficient rotor RPM. The <i>amount</i> that the 
collective pitch can be lowered will depend on the altitude available at the 
time the low rotor RPM condition occurs. When hovering near the surface, the 
collective pitch should be lowered cautiously to preclude hard contact with 
the surface. When the RPM begins to increase and attains approximately 
normal rotor operating RPM, anticipate decreasing the throttle slowly to 
prevent the engine from overspeeding.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If recovery from a low rotor RPM condition is not made 
soon enough, lifting power of the main rotor blades will be lost, including 
pedal effectiveness. Pedal ineffectiveness occurs as a result of the loss of 
tail rotor RPM because the tail rotor RPM is directly proportional to the 
main rotor RPM. If pedal effectiveness is lost, and the altitude is such 
that a landing can be made before the turning rate increases dangerously, 
decrease collective pitch slowly, maintain a level attitude with cyclic 
control, and land.

<a name="s turns">"S" TURNS</a>
</b></font></center>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"S" turns present one of the elementary problems in 
the practical application of the turn and in the correction for wind drift 
in turns. The reference line used, whether a road, railroad, or fence, 
should be straight for a considerable distance and should extend as nearly 
perpendicular to the wind as possible.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of "S" turns is to fly a pattern of two 
half circles of equal size on opposite sides of the reference line 
<a href="Chapter_11.html#fig 80">(fig. 80)</a>. The maneuver should be 
started at an altitude of 500 feet above the terrain and a constant altitude 
maintained throughout the maneuver. "S" turns may be started at any point. 
However, during early training, it may be beneficial to start on a downwind 
heading. Entering downwind permits the immediate selection of the steepest 
bank that is desired throughout the maneuver. The discussion that follows 
is based on choosing a reference line that is perpendicular to the wind and 
starting the maneuver on a downwind heading.

</center>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the helicopter crosses the reference line, a bank 
is immediately established. This initial bank will be the steepest used 
throughout the maneuver since the helicopter is headed directly downwind. 
The bank should be gradually reduced as necessary to describe a ground 
track of a half circle. The turn should be timed so that, as the rollout is 
compleleted, the helicopter is crossing the reference line perpendicular to 
it and headed directly upwind. A bank is immediately entered in the opposite 
direction to begin the second half of the "S." Since the helicopter is on 
an upwind heading, this bank (and the one just completed before crossing the 
reference line) will be shallowest in the maneuver. It should be gradually 
increase as necessary to describe a ground track which is a half circle 
identical in size to the one previously completed on the other side of the 
reference line. The steepest bank in this turn should be attained just prior 
to rollout (when the helicopter is approaching the reference line nearest to 
a downwind heading). This bank, along with the initial bank entered at the 
beginning of the maneuver, will be the steepest bank used in "S" turns. The 
turn should be timed so that as the rollout is completed, the helicopter is 
crossing the refence line perpendicular to it and again headed directly 
downwind.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a summary, the angle of bank required at any given 
point in the maneuver is dependent on the groundspeed--the faster the 
groundspeed, the steeper the bank; the slower the groundspeed, the shallower 
the bank. Or, to express it another way, the more nearly the helicopter is 
to a downwind heading, the steeper the bank; the more nearly it is to an 
upwind heading, the shallower the bank.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to varying the angle of bank to correct 
for drift in order to maintain the proper radius of turn, the helicopter 
must also be flown with a drift correction angle (crab) in relation to its 
ground track, except of course, when it is on direct upwind or downwind 
headings or there is no wind. One would normally think of fore and aft axis 
of the helicopter as being tangent to the ground track pattern at each 
point. However, this is not the case. During the turn on the upwind side of 
the reference line (side from which the wind is blowing), the nose of the 
helicopter will be crabbed toward the outside of the circle. During the turn 
on the downwind side of the reference line (side of the reference line 
oppposite to the direction from which the wind is blowing), the nose of the 
helicopter will be crabbed toward the inside of the circle. In either case, 
it is obvious that the helicopter is being crabbed into the wind just as it 
is when trying to maintain a straight ground track. The amount of crab 
depends upon the wind velocity and how nearly the helicopter is to a 
crosswind position. The stronger the wind, the greater the crab angle at any 
given position for a turn of a given radius. The more nearly the helicopter 
is to a crosswind position, the greater the crab angle. The maximum crab 
angle should be at the point of each half circle farthest from the reference 
line.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A standard radius for "S" turns cannot be specified. 
This radius will depend on the airspeed of the helicopter, the velocity of 
the wind, and the initial bank chosen for entry.
