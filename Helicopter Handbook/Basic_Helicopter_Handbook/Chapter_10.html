<br><font size=+2>PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES
<br>AND CRITICAL CONDITIONS</font></b></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of their unique flight characteristics, 
helicopters are capable of missions other aircraft cannot perform. 
Helicopter pilots must, however, realize the hazards involved in flying 
and know what precautions to take that may save their helicopters or 
even their lives.

<blockquote><b>General precautionary rules</b>
<br>1. Do not perform acrobatic maneuvers.
<br>2. Do not check magnetos in flight.
<br>3. Use caution when adjusting mixture in flight.
<br>4. Always taxi slowly.
<br>5. Always check ballast prior to flying.
<br>6. Use caution when hovering on the leeward side
<br>of buildings or obstructions.
<br>7. Do not hover at an altitude that will place you in the
<br>shaded area of the height-velocity chart.
<br>8. Always hover for a moment before beginning a new flight.
<br>9. When flying in rough, gusty air, use special care to
<br>maintain proper RPM.
<br>10. When practicing hovering turns, sideward flight, and
<br>similar low airspeed maneuvers, be especially
<br>careful to maintain proper RPM.
<br>11. Always clear the area overhead, ahead, to each side,
<br>and below before entering practice autorotations.
<br>12. Make sure any object placed in the cockpit of a helicopter
<br>is secured to prevent fouling of the controls.
<br>13. Except in sideward or rearward flight, always fly the
<br>helicopter in relationship to references ahead.
</blockquote>

<p><br><b><a name="rotor rpm limits">Rotor RPM operating limits</a></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Limits of rotor RPM vary with each type of helicopter. 
In general, the lower limit is determined primarily by the control 
characteristics of the helicopter during autorotation. Since the tail 
rotor is driven by the main rotor, a minimum main rotor RPM exists at 
which tail rotor thrust is sufficient for proper heading control. Below 
this minimum main rotor RPM, full pedal application will not maintain 
heading control under certain conditions of flight.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upper limit for rotor RPM is based on both 
autorotative characteristics and structural strength of the rotor 
system. Structural tests plus an adequate margin for safety are 
required by FAA safety standards for the certification of aircraft. 

<p><b>Extreme attitudes and overcontrolling</b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Design characteristics of nearly all helicopters 
preclude the possibility of safe inverted flight. Avoid all maneuvers 
which would place a helicopter in danger of such an extreme attitude.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avoid loading a helicopter so as to cause an extreme 
tail-low attitude when taking off to a hover. Aft center of gravity 
is dangerous while hovering and even more dangerous while in flight 
because of limited forward cyclic stick effectiveness.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avoid heavy loading forward of center of gravity. 
The result is limited aft cyclic stick effectiveness, which endangers 
controllability.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avoid an extreme nose-low attitude when executing 
a normal takeoff. Such an attitude may require more power than the engine 
can deliver and will allow the helicopter to settle to the surface in an 
unsafe landing attitude. In the event of a forced landing, only a 
comparatively level attitude can assure a safe touchdown.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avoid abrupt application of rearward cyclic control. 
The violent backward-pitching action of the rotor disc may cause the 
main rotor blades to flex downward into the tail boom.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avoid large or unnecessary movements of the cyclic 
control while at a hover. Such movements of the cyclic control can, 
under certain conditions, cause sufficient loss of lift to make the 
helicopter settle to the surface.

<p><b><a name="flight technique in hot weather">
Flight technique in hot weather</a></b>

<blockquote>&nbsp;
<br>1. Make full use of wind and translational lift.
<br>2. Hover as low as possible and no longer than necessary.
<br>3. Maintain maximum allowable engine RPM.
<br>4. Accelerate very slowly into forward flight.
<br>5. Employ running takeoffs and landings when necessary.
<br>6. Use caution in maximum performance takeoffs and steep approaches.
<br>7. Avoid high rates of descent in all approaches.</blockquote>

<p><br><b>
<a name="instruments">Effect of altitude on instrument readings</a></b>

<p>The thinner air of higher altitudes causes the airspeed indicator to 
read &quot;too low&quot;. True airspeed may be roughly computed by adding 
to the indicated airspeed, 2 percent of indicated airspeed for each 1,000 
feet of altitude above sea level. For example, an indicated airspeed of 
80 MPH at 5,000 feet will be a true airspeed of approximately 88 MPH. 
This computation may be made more accurately by using a computer.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manifold pressure is reduced approximately 1 inch 
for each 1,000 feet of increase in altitude. If a maximum manifold 
pressure of 28 inches can be obtained at an elevation of 1,000 feet, 
only 22 inches of manifold pressure will be available at 7,000 feet. 
This loss of manifold pressure must be considered when planning 
flights from low altitudes to high altitudes.

<p><b><a name="high altitude">High altitude pilot technique</a></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of three major factors limiting helicopter performance 
at high altitudes (gross weight, density altitude, and wind), only gross 
weight may be controlled by the pilot of a helicopter that is equipped 
with an unsupercharged engine, At the expense of range, smaller amounts 
of fuel may be carried to improve performance or to increase the number 
of passengers or the amount of baggage. Where practical, running landings 
and takeoffs should be used. Make maximum use of favorable wind, with 
landings and takeoffs made directly into the wind if possible.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the wind blows over large obstructions such 
as mountain ridges, a condition is set up similar to that depicted in 
the upper right portion of <a href="Chapter_12.html#fig 81">figure 81</a>; 
however, it is a much more disturbed condition. The wind blowing up the 
slope on the windward side is usually relatively smooth. However, on the 
leeward side the wind spills rapidly down the slope, similar to the way 
water flows down a rough streambed, setting up strong downdrafts and 
causing the air to be very turbulent <a href="chapter_10.html#fig 67">
(fig. 67)</a>. The downdrafts can be very violent and may cause aircraft to 
strike the sides of the mountains. Therefore, when approaching mountain 
ridges against the wind, it is sound practice to make an extra altitude 
allowance to assure safe terrain clearance. Where pronounced mountain ridges 
and strong winds are present, a clearance of 2,000 or 3,000 feet above the 
terrain is considered a desirable minimum. Also, it is advisable to climb to 
the crossing altitude well before reaching the mountains to avoid having to 
make the climb in a persistent downdraft.

aircraft in flight.</font>
</center>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When operating over mountainous terrain, fly on 
the upwind side of slopes to take advantage of updrafts. When landing 
on ridges, the safest approach is usually made lengthwise of the ridge. 
Fly near the upwind edge to avoid possible downdrafts and to be in 
position to autorotate down the upwind side of the slope in case of 
a forced landing. &quot;Riding&quot; the updraft in this manner results 
in a lower rate of descent, improved glide ratio, and greater choice of 
a landing area.

<p><b><a name="tall grass and water">Tall grass and water operations</a></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tall grass will tend to disperse or absorb the 
ground effect. More power will be required to hover, and takeoff may 
be very difficult. Before attempting to hover over tall grass, make 
sure that at least 2 or 3 inches more manifold pressure is available 
than is required to hover over normal terrain.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operations over water with a smooth or glassy 
surface renders accurate altitude determination very difficult. Thus, 
caution must be exercised to prevent the helicopter from inadvertently 
striking the water. This problem does not exist over rough water, but 
a very rough water surface may disperse the ground effect and, thereby, 
require more power to hover. Movements of the water surface, wind 
ripples, waves, currentflow, or even agitation by the helicopter's 
own rotor wash tend to give the pilot a false feeling of helicopter 
movement.

<p><font size=+1><a name="carb icing">CARBURETOR ICING</a></font></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carburetor icing is a frequent cause of engine 
failure. The vaporization of fuel, combined with the expansion of air 
as it passes through the carburetor may drop as much as 60&deg; F. 
within a fraction of a second. Water vapor in the air is &quot;squeezed 
out&quot; by this cooling, and if the temperature in the carburetor 
reaches 32&deg; F. or below, the moisture will be deposited as frost 
or ice inside the carburetor passages. Even a slight accumulation of 
this deposit will reduce power and may lead to complete engine failure, 
particularly when the throttle is partly or fully closed.

<p>
<b><a name="favorable con">Conditions favorable for carburetor icing</a></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On dry days, or when the temperature is well below 
freezing, the moisture in the air is not generally enough to cause 
trouble. But if the temperature is between 20&deg; F. and 70&deg; F., 
with visible moisture or high humidity, the pilot should be constantly 
on the alert for carburetor ice. During low or closed throttle settings, 
an engine is particularly susceptible to carburetor icing.

<p><b><a name="carb ice ind">Indications of carburetor icing</a></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indications of carburetor ice include unexplained 
loss of RPM or manifold pressure, the carburetor air temperature 
indicating in the &quot;danger&quot; (red arc) or &quot;caution&quot; 
(yellow arc) range, and engine roughness. A loss of manifold pressure 
will generally give the first indication; however, due to the many 
small control (setting) changes made in the throttle and collective 
pitch, this may be less noticeable. Therefore, a close check of the 
carburetor air temperature gauge is necessary so that carburetor heat 
may be adjusted to keep the carburetor air temperature gauge out of 
the red and yellow arcs.

<p><b><a name="carb temp gage">Carburetor air temperature gauge</a></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carburetor air temperature gauges are marked with 
a green arc representing the range of desired operating temperatures; 
a yellow arc representing the range of temperatures in which caution 
should be exercised since icing is possible; and a red line representing 
the maximum operating temperature limit. Sometimes a red arc is used to 
represent the most dangerous range in which carburetor ice can be 
anticipated. The carburetor heat control should be adjusted so that 
the carburetor air temperature remains in the green arc.

<p><b><a name="carb heat">Use of carburetor heat</a></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carburetor heater is an anti-icing device that 
preheats the air before it reaches the carburetor. This preheating can 
be used to melt ice or snow entering the intake duct, to melt ice that 
forms in the carburetor passages (provided the accumulation is not too 
great), and to keep the fuel mixture above the freezing point to prevent 
formation of carburetor ice.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When conditions are favorable for carburetor icing, 
the pilot should make the proper check to see if any is present. The 
manifold pressure gauge should be checked, then full carburetor heat 
applied until it is certain that if ice was present, it has been 
removed. (During this check a constant throttle and collective pitch 
setting should be maintained.) The carburetor heat should then be 
returned to the OFF (cold) position. If manifold pressure gauge indicates 
higher than when the check was initiated, carburetor ice was present.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When there are indications of carburetor icing, 
full carburetor heat should be applied until the manifold pressure 
returns to normal and the engine is running smoothly. The carburetor 
heat should then be adjusted so that the carburetor air temperature 
gauge indicates a safe operating range.

<p><b><a name="fuel injection">Fuel injection</a></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuel injection systems have replaced carburetors 
in some helicopters. In the fuel injection system, the fuel is normally 
injected into the system either directly into the cylinders or just 
ahead of the intake valve. In the carburetor system, fuel enters the 
airstream at the throttle valve. The fuel injection system is generally 
considered to be less susceptible to icing than the carburetor system.
