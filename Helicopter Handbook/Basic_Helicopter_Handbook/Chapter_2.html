<p>POWERED FLIGHT</b></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any kind of flight (hovering, vertical, forward, 
sideward, or rearward), the total lift and thrust forces of a rotor are 
perpendicular to the tip-path plane or plane of rotation of the rotor 
<a href="chapter_2.html#fig 9">(fig. 9)</a>. The tip-path plane is the 
imaginary circular plane outlined by the rotor blade tips in making a cycle 
of rotation.

<p><b><a name="forces">Forces acting on the helicopter</a></b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During any kind of horizontal or vertical flight, 
there are four forces acting on the helicopter--lift, thrust, weight, 
and drag. Lift is the force required to support the weight of the 
helicopter. Thrust is the force required to overcome the drag on the 
fuselage and other helicopter components.

<p><i><a name="hovering">Hovering flight.-</a>
</i> During hovering flight in a no-wind condition, 
the tip-path plane is horizontal, that is, parallel to the ground. Lift 
and thrust act straight up; weight and drag act straight down. The sum 
of the lift and thrust must equal the sum of the weight and drag forces 
in order for the helicopter to hover.

<br><font size=-1>Figure 10.- Forces acting on the helicopter during a 
hover and vertical flight.</font>
</center>

<p><i><a name="vertical">Vertical flight.-</a>
</i> During vertical flight in a no-wind condition, 
the lift and thrust forces both act vertically upward. Weight and drag 
both act vertically downward. When lift and thrust equal weight and drag, 
the helicopter hovers; if lift and thrust are less than weight and drag, 
the helicopter descends vertically; if lift and thrust are greater than 
weight and drag, the helicopter rises vertically 
<a href="chapter_2.html#fig 10">(fig. 10)</a>.

<p><i><a name="forward">Forward flight.-</a>
</i> For forward flight, the tip-path plane is tilted 
forward, thus tilting the total lift-thrust force forward from the vertical. 
This resultant lift-thrust force can be resolved into two components--lift 
acting vertically upward and thrust acting horizontally in the direction 
of flight. In addition to lift and thrust, there are weight, the downward 
acting force, and drag, the rearward acting or retarding force of inertia 
and wind resistance <a href="chapter_2.html#fig 11">(fig. 11)</a>.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In straight-and-level unaccelerated forward flight, 
lift equals weight and thrust equals drag (straight-and-level flight is 
flight with a constant heading and at a constant altitude). If lift 
exceeds weight, the helicopter climbs; if lift less than weight, the 
helicopter descends. If thrust exceeds drag, the helicopter speeds up; 
if thrust is less than drag, it slows down.

forward, sideward, and rearward flight.</font>
</center>

<p><i><a name="sideward">Sideward flight.-</a>
</i> In sideward flight, the tip-path plane is 
tilted sideward in the direction that flight is desired thus the total 
lift-thrust vector sideward. In this case, the vertical or lift component 
is still straight up, weight straight down, but the horizontal or thrust 
component now acts sideward with drag acting to the opposite side 
<a href="chapter_2.html#fig 11">(fig. 11)</a>.

<p><i><a name="rearward">Rearward flight.-</a>
</i> For rearward flight, the tip-path plane is 
tilted rearward tilting the lift-thrust vector rearward. The thrust 
component is rearward and drag forward, just the opposite to forward 
flight. The lift component is straight up and weight straight down 
<a href="chapter_2.html#fig 11">(fig. 11)</a>.

<p><b><a name="torque">Torque.-</a></b> 
Newton's third law of motion states, &quot;To every 
action there is an equal and opposite reaction.&quot; As the main rotor 
of a helicopter turns in one direction, the fuselage tends to rotate in 
the opposite direction <a href="chapter_2.html#fig 12">(fig. 12)</a>. This 
tendency for the fuselage to rotate is called torque. Since torque effect 
on the fuselage is a direct result of engine power supplied to the main 
rotor, any change in engine power brings about a corresponding change in 
torque effect. The greater the engine power, the greater the torque effect. 
Since there is no engine power being supplied to the main rotor during 
autorotation, there is no torque reaction during autorotation.

the torque effect of the main rotor.</font>
</center>

<p><b><a name="aux rotor">Auxiliary rotor.-</a></b> The force that 
compensates for torque and keeps the fuselage from turning in the direction 
opposite to the main rotor is produced by means of an auxiliary rotor 
located on the end of the tail boom. This auxiliary rotor, generally 
referred to as a <i>tail rotor</i>, or antitorque rotor, produces thrust in 
the direction opposite to torque reaction developed by the main rotor 
<a href="chapter_2.html#fig 12">(fig. 12)</a>. Foot pedals in the cockpit 
permit the pilot to increase or decrease tail-rotor thrust, as needed, to 
neutralize torque effect.

<p><b><a name="gyro precession">Gyroscopic precession.-</a>
</b> The spinning main rotor of a helicopter 
acts like a gyroscope. As such, it has the properties of gyroscopic action, 
one of which is precession. Gyroscopic precession is the resultant action 
or deflection of a spinning object when a force is applied to this object. 
This action occurs approximately 90&deg; in the direction of rotation 
from the point where the force is applied <a href="chapter_2.html#fig 13">
(fig. 13)</a>. Through the use of this principle, the tip-path plane of the 
main rotor may be tilted from the horizontal.

<br><font size=-1>Figure 13.- Gyroscopic Precession Principle: 
When a force is applied to a spinning gyro, the maximum 
<br>reaction occurs 90&deg; later in the direction of rotation.</font>
</center>
<a name="angle of attack"></a>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The movement of the cyclic pitch control in a 
two-bladed rotor system increases the angle of attack of one rotor blade 
with the result that a greater lifting force is applied at this point in 
the plane of rotation. This same control movement simultaneously decreases 
the angle of attack of the other blade a like amount, thus decreasing the 
lifting force applied at this point in the plane of rotation. The blade 
with the increased angle of attack tends to rise; the blade with the 
decreased angle of attack tends to lower. However, because of the gyroscopic 
precession property, the blades do not rise or lower to maximum deflection 
until a point approximately 90&deg; later in the plane of rotation. 
In the illustration <a href="chapter_2.html#fig 14">(fig. 14)</a>, the 
retreating blade angle of attack is increased and the advancing blade angle 
of attack is decreased resulting in a tipping forward of the tip-path plane, 
since maximum deflection takes place 90&deg; later when the blades are at 
the rear and front respectively.

a rotor blade pitch change is made, maximum reaction occurs 
<br>approximately 90&deg; later in the direction of rotation.</font>
</center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a three-bladed rotor, the movement of the cyclic 
pitch control changes the angle of attack of each blade an appropriate 
amount so that the end result is the same--a tipping forward of the 
tip-path plane when the maximum change in angle of attack is made as each 
blade passes the same points at which the maximum increase and decrease 
are made in the illustration <a href="chapter_2.html#fig 14">(fig. 14)</a> 
for the two-bladed rotor. As each blade passes the 90&deg; position on the 
left, the maximum increase in angle of attack occurs. As each blade passes 
the 90&deg; position to the right, the maximum decrease in angle of attack 
occurs. Maximum deflection takes place 90&deg; later--maximum upward 
deflection at the rear and maximum downward deflection at the front--and 
the tip-path plane tips forward.

<p><b><a name="dissymmetry">Dissymmetry of lift.-</a></b> 
The area within the tip-path plane of the 
main rotor is know as the <i>disc area or rotor disc</i>. When hovering 
in still air, lift created by the rotor blades at all corresponding 
positions around the rotor disc is equal. Dissymmerty of lift is created 
by horizontal flight or by wind during hovering flight, and is the 
difference in lift that exists between the advancing blade half of the 
disc area and the retreating blade half.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At normal rotor operating RPM and zero airspeed, the 
rotating blade-tip speed of most helicopter main rotors is approximately 
400 miles per hour. When hovering in a no-wind condition, the speed of 
the relative wind at the blade tip is the same throughout the tip-path 
plane <a href="chapter_2.html#fig 15">(fig. 15, bottom)</a>. The speed of 
the relative wind at any specific point along the rotor blade will be the 
same throughout the tip-path plane; however, the speed is reduced as this 
point moves closer to the rotor hub as indicated by the two inner circles. 
As the helicopter moves into forward flight, the relative wind moving over 
each rotor blade becomes a combination of the rotational speed of the rotor 
and the forward movement of the helicopter <a href="chapter_2.html#fig 15">
(fig. 15, top)</a>. At the 90&deg; position on the left side, the retreating 
blade speed is the blade velocity less the speed of the helicopter. (In the 
illustration, the helicopter is assumed to have a forward airspeed of 100 
miles per hour.) In other words, the relative wind speed is at a maximum at 
the 90&deg; position on the right side and at a minimum at the 90&deg; 
position on the left side.

speeds for the advancing blade and the retreating blade 
<br>during hovering and forward flight.</font>
</center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier in this handbook, the statement was made that 
for any given angle of attack, lift increases as the velocity of the 
airflow over the airfoil increases. It is apparent that the lift over the 
advancing blade half of the rotor disc will be greater than the lift over 
the retreating blade half during horizontal flight, or when hovering in a 
wind unless some compensation is made. The compensation made to equalize 
the lift over the two halves of the rotor disc is blade flapping and 
cyclic feathering. (see <a href="Chapter_5.html#feather">chapter 5</a> for 
more information about feathering)

<br><font size=-1>Figure 16.- Flapping action about the

</center>

<p><b><a name="blade flapping">Blade flapping.-<a/></b>
 In a three-bladed rotor system, the rotor blades 
are attached to the rotor hub by a horizontal hinge which permits the blades 
to move in a vertical plane, i.e., flap up or down, as they rotate 
<a href="chapter_2.html#fig 16">(fig. 16)</a>. In forward flight and 
assuming that the blade-pitch angle remains constant, the increased lift on 
the advancing blade will cause the angle of attack because the relative wind 
will change from a horizontal direction to more of a downward direction. The 
decreased lift on the retreating blade will cause the blade to flap down 
increasing the angle of attack because the relative wind changes from a 
horizontal direction to more of an upward direction 
<a href="chapter_1.html#fig 3">(fig. 3)</a>. The combination of decreased 
angle of attack on the advancing blade and increased angle of attack on the 
retreating blade through blade flapping action tends to equalize the lift 
over the two halves of the rotor disc.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a two-bladed system, the blades flap as a unit. 
As the advancing blade flaps up due to the increased lift, the retreating 
blade flaps down due to the decreased lift. The change in angle of attack 
on each blade brought about by this flapping action tends to equalize the 
lift over the two halves of the rotor disc.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position of the cyclic pitch control in forward 
flight also causes a decrease in angle of attack on the advancing blade 
and an increase in angle of attack on the retreating blade. this, together 
with blade flapping, equalizes lift over the two halves of the rotor disc.

<p><b><a name="coning">Coning.-</a></b> 
Coning is the upward bending of the blades caused by 
the combined forces of lift and centrifugal force. Before takeoff, the 
blades rotate in a plane nearly perpendicular to the rotor mast, since 
centrifugal force is the major force acting on them 
<a href="chapter_2.html#fig 17">(fig. 17)</a>.

&nbsp;

<br><font size=-1>Figure 17.- Blade coning is a result of 
lift and centrifugal force.</font>
</center>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a vertical takeoff is made, two major forces are 
acting at the same time--centrifugal force acting outward perpendicular 
to the rotor mast and lift acting upward and parallel to the mast. The 
result of these two forces is that the blades assume a conical path 
instead of remaining in the plane perpendicular to the mast 
<a href="chapter_2.html#fig 17">(fig. 17)</a>.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coning results in blade bending in a semirigid rotor; 
in an articulated rotor; the blades assume an upward angle through movement 
about the flapping hinges.

<p><b><a name="axis of rotation">Axis of rotation.-</a></b> 
The axis of rotation of a helicopter rotor 
is the imaginary line about which the rotor rotates. It is represented 
by a line drawn through the center of, and perpendicular to, the tip-path 
plane. It is not to be confused with the rotor mast. The only time the 
rotor axis of rotation coincides with the rotor mast is when the tip-path 
plane is perpendicular to the rotor mast <a href="chapter_2.html#fig 18">
(fig. 18)</a>.

</center>

<p><b><a name="coriolis">Coriolis effect.-</a></b> 
When a rotor blade of a three-bladed rotor 
system flaps upward, the center of mass of that blade moves closer to the 
axis of rotation and blade <i>acceleration</i> takes place. Conversely, 
when that blade flaps downward, its center of mass moves further from the 
axis of rotation and blade <i>deceleration</i> takes place 
<a href="chapter_2.html#fig 19">(fig. 19)</a>. (Keep in mind, that due to 
coning, the rotor blade will not flap below a plane passing through the 
rotor hub and perpendicular to the axis of rotation.) The acceleration and 
deceleration actions (often referred to as leading, lagging, or hunting) of 
the rotor blades are absorbed by either dampers or the blade structure 
itself, depending upon the design of the rotor system.

<br>to compensate for the change in distance of the center 
<br>of mass from the axis of rotation as the blades flap.</font>
</center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two-bladed rotor systems are normally subject to 
CORIOLIS EFFECT to a much lesser degree than are three-bladed systems 
since the blades are generally &quot;underslung&quot; with respect to the 
rotor hub, and the change in the distance of the center of mass from the 
axis of rotation is small. The hunting action is absorbed by the blades 
through bending. If a two-bladed rotor system is not &quot;underslung,&quot; 
it will be subject to CORIOLIS EFFECT comparable to that of a fully 
articulated system.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CORIOLIS EFFECT might be compared to spinning skaters. 
When they extend their arms, their rotation slows down because their center 
of mass moves farther from their axis of rotation. When their arms are 
retracted, their rotation speeds up because their center of mass moves 
closer to their axis of rotation.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tendency of a rotor blade to increase or decrease 
its velocity in its plane of rotation due to mass movement is known as 
CORIOLIS EFFECT, named for the mathematician who made studies of forces 
generated by radial movements of mass on a rotating disc.

<p><b><a name="drift">Translating tendency or drift.-</a></b> 
The entire helicopter has a 
tendency to move in the direction of tail rotor thrust (to the right) 
when hovering. This movement is often referred to as &quot;drift.&quot; To 
counteract this drift, the rotor mast in some helicopters is rigged slightly 
to the left side so that the tip-path plane has a built-in tilt to the left, 
thus producing a small sideward thrust. In other helicopters, drift is 
overcome by rigging the cyclic pitch system to give the required amount of 
tilt to the tip-path plane <a href="chapter_2.html#fig 20">(fig. 20)</a>.

<center>

<br><font size=-1>Figure 20.- Drift, caused by tail rotor thrust, is 
compensated for by rigging the mast or cyclic pitch system 
<br>to have a built-in tilt of the tip-path plane to the left.</font>
</center>

<p><b><a name="ground effect">Ground effect.-</a>
</b> When a helicopter is operated near the surface, 
the downwash velocity created by the rotor blades cannot be fully developed 
due to the proximity of the surface. This restraint of rotor downwash occurs 
as the helicopter reaches a relatively low altitude--usually less than 
one rotor diameter above the surface <a href="chapter_2.html#fig 21">
(fig. 21)</a>.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the downwash velocity is reduced, the induced 
angle of attack of each rotor blade is reduced and the lift vector becomes 
more vertical. Simultaneously, a reduction in induced drag occurs. In 
addition, as the <i>induced</i> angle of attack is reduced, the angle of 
attack generating lift is increased. The net result of these actions is 
a beneficial increase in lift and a lower power requirement to support 
a given weight.

<br><font size=-1>Figure 21.- Ground effect results when the rotor downwash 
<br>field is altered from its free air state by the 
presence of the surface.</font>
</center>

<p><b><a name="translational lift">Translational lift.-</a>
</b> Translational lift is that additional lift 
obtained when entering horizontal flight, due to the increased efficiency 
of the rotor system. The rotor system produces more lift in forward flight 
because the higher inflow velocity supplies the rotor disc with a greater 
mass of air per unit time upon which to work than it receives while 
hovering. Translational lift is present with any horizontal movement 
although the increase will not be noticeable until airspeed reaches 
approximately 15 miles per hour. The additional lift available at this speed 
is referred to as &quot;effective translational lift&quot; and is easily 
recognized in actual flight by the increased performance of the helicopter.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since translational lift depends upon airspeed rather 
than groundspeed, the helicopter does not have to be in horizontal flight 
to be affected. Translational lift will be present during hovering flight 
in a wind--the amount being proportional to the wind velocity--and 
effective translational lift will be present when hovering in winds of 
15 MPH or more.

<p><b><a name="transverse flow">Transverse flow effect.-</a>
</b> In forward flight, air passing through 
the rear portion of the rotor disc has a higher downwash velocity than 
air passing through the forward portion. This is because the air passing 
through the rear portion has been accelerated for a longer period of time 
than the air passing through the forward portion. This increased downwash 
velocity at the rear of the disc decreases the angle of attack and blade 
lift, hence in combination with gyroscopic precession, causes the rotor 
disc to tilt to the right (the advancing side). The lift on the forward 
part of the rotor disc is greater than on the rearward part. According 
to the principle of gyroscopic precession, maximum deflection of the rotor 
blades occurs 90&deg; later in the direction of rotation. This means 
that the rotor blades will reach maximum upward upward deflection on the 
left side and maximum downward deflection on the right side. This transverse 
flow effect is responsible for the major portion of the lateral cyclic 
stick control required to trim the helicopter at low speed.

<p><b><a name="pendular action">Pendular action.-</a>
</b> Since the fuselage of the helicopter is 
suspended from a single point and has considerable mass, it is free to 
oscillate either longitudinally or laterally in the same way as a pendulum 
<a href="chapter_2.html#fig 22">(fig, 22)</a>. This pendular action can be 
exaggerated by overcontrolling; therefore, control stick movements should be 
moderate.

<center>
<p><b><font size=+1><a name="autorotations">AUTOROTATION</a></font></b>
</center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Autorotation is the term used for the flight condition 
during which no engine power is supplied and the main rotor is driven only 
by the action of the relative wind. It is the means of safely landing a 
helicopter after engine failure or certain other emergencies. The 
helicopter transmission or power train is designed so that the engine, 
when it stops, is automatically disengaged from the main rotor system to 
allow the main rotor to rotate freely in its original direction. For 
obvious reasons, this autorotational capability is not only a most 
desirable characteristic but is indeed a capability required of all 
helicopters before FAA certification is granted.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When engine power is being supplied to the main rotor, 
the flow of air is downward through the rotor. When engine power is not 
being supplied to the main rotor, that is, when the helicopter is in 
autorotation, the flow of air is upward through the rotor. It is this 
upward flow of air that causes the rotor to continue turning after engine 
failure.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The portion of the rotor blade that produces the 
forces that cause the rotor to turn when the engine is no longer supplying 
power to the rotor is that portion between approximately 25 percent and 
70 percent of the radius outward from the center. This portion is often 
referred to as the &quot;autorotative or driving region&quot; 
<a href="chapter_2.html#fig 23">(fig. 23)</a>. Aerodynamic forces along this 
portion of the blade tend to speed up the blade rotation.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inner 25 percent of the rotor blade, referred to 
as the &quot;stall region,&quot; operates above its maximum angle of attack 
(stall angle), thereby contributing little lift but considerable drag which 
tends to slow the blade rotation.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outer 30 percent of the rotor blade is known as 
the &quot;propeller or driven region.&quot; Aerodynamic forces here result 
in a small drag force which tends to slow the tip portion of the blade.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aerodynamic regions as described above are for 
vertical autorotations. During forward flight autorotations, these 
regions are displaced across the rotor disc to the left 
<a href="chapter_2.html#fig 23">(fig. 23)</a>.

</center>

<p><b><a name="rpm">Rotor RPM during autorotation</a></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotor RPM stabilizes when the autorotative forces 
(thrust) of the &quot;driving region&quot; and the antiautorotative forces 
(drag) of the &quot;driven region&quot; and &quot;stall region&quot; are 
equal. Assume that rotor RPM has been increased by entering an updraft; a 
general lessening in angle of attack will follow along the entire blade. 
This produces a change in aerodynamic force vectors which results in an 
overall decrease in the autorotative forces and the rotor tends to slow 
down, If rotor RPM has been decreased by entering a downdraft, autorotative 
forces will tend to accelerate the rotor back to is equilibrium RPM.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming a constant collective pitch setting, that 
is, a constant rotor blade pitch angle, an overall greater angle of attack 
of the rotor disc (as in a flare) increases rotor RPM; a lessening in 
overall angle of attack (such as "pushing over" into a descent) decreases 
rotor RPM.

<p><b><a name="flare">Flares during autorotation</a></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forward speed during autorotative descent permits a 
pilot to incline the rotor disc rearward, thus causing a flare. The 
additional induced lift created by the greater volume of air momentarily 
checks forward speed as well as descent. The greater volume of air acting 
on the rotor disc will normally increase rotor RPM during the flare. As 
the forward speed and descent rate near zero, the upward flow of air has 
practically ceased and rotor RPM again decreases; the helicopter settles 
at a slightly increased rate but with reduced forward speed. The flare 
enables the pilot to make an emergency landing on a definite spot with
