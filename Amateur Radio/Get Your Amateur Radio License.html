<br>
<p>It is now easier than ever to get your Amateur Radio License. When I first went to get my license, there were five different classes of licenses:<br>
<ul>
<li>Novice</li>
<li>Technician</li>
<li>General</li>
<li>Advanced</li>
<li>Amateur Extra</li>
</ul></p>
<p>The novice required you pass a Morse code copy test of 5 WPM (words per minute) as well as the written test. Then you had privileges to work a small 
portion of some of the HF bands in the CW only portion of the band. Then if you passed the written Technician test, you gained some voice privileges 
on the some of the VHF and UHF bands. Next it's time to move on to General. You needed to up CW copy to 13 WPM and another written test. Now you got 
a larger portion of the HF bands and voice on some them. You also got a larger portion of the VHF and UHF bands. Now to advance to Advanced class; just 
a written test. With it you get more bands and greater portions of the bands. The Amateur Extra is the highest you can go. You do have to upgrade the 
code test to 20 WPM. You get full use of all the available bands.</p>
<p>Now a days there is no more code test. There are only three classes that just have written tests: Technician, General, and Extra. You are given 
the entire question pools and the answers for the multiple choice questions to study. Can't get any easier than that.</p>
<p>Now that we are done with the history lesson; let's get on with learning to pass the exam.</p>
<br>
<p><font size="+3"><b>Studying</b></font><br></p>
<p>
With the test being like it is, to my understanding most schools only teach you to pass the test nowadays. So you don't really need to know basic 
electronics, but it can't hurt to know some. So I made up this page that has some of the basics.
<ul>
<li><a href="Electrical and Electronic Basics.html">Electrical and Electronic Basics</a></li>
</ul>
I made up these html pages of the Question Pools for my use offline. I mostly didn't have Internet except on my phone. Trying to study them on 
my phone really sucks. And I really dislike pdfs. With html I can have links to jump around instead of trying to scroll thru 90 pages to get to the 
images the question may be referring to like you need to do with a pdf. So here are the pages I made:
<ul>
<li><a href="Technician Class Question Pool and Syllabus 2022-2026.html">Technician Class Question Pool and Syllabus 2022-2026</a></li>
<li><a href="General Class Question Pool and Syllabus 2023-2027.html">General Class Question Pool and Syllabus 2023-2027</a></li>
<li><a href="Extra Class Question Pool and Syllabus 2024-2028.html">Extra Class Question Pool and Syllabus 2024-2028</a></li>
</ul>
Now that I have internet, I found this site that seems really good. It's free. It states that if you register with it, it will track your 
progress and help with the areas you are having trouble with. It also has practice test for you to take. The second one, my daughter pointed out 
to me. It seems good too.

<p>Find a local club<br>
Many local ham radio clubs are ARRL affiliated, and they can help you find an in-person exam.<br>
This ARRL page will look up test sites by zipcode, make sure to select how far your willing to travel in the drop down box next to where you enter 
the zipcode and the date boxes at the bottom.<br>

<p>What you need to take with you when you go to take the test:
<ul>
<li>Legal Photo ID</li>
<li>Two number two pencils and a pen</li>
<li>FRN (FCC Registration Number). You should register for your FRN here;<br> 
<a href="https://apps2.fcc.gov/fccUserReg/pages/createAccount.htm">https://apps2.fcc.gov/fccUserReg/pages/createAccount.htm</a>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp or 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/cores/userLogin.do">https://apps.fcc.gov/cores/userLogin.do</a> 
</li>
<li>$15 Cash (or more, since the volunteers will usually let you try again for an additional fee if you have some trouble!)</li>
<li>Calculator (optional)</li>
</ul></p>
<br>
<p><font size="+3"><b>Congratulations, You've Earned Your License!​</b></font><br></p>
<p>After the test. The volunteers examiners will give you an official signed paper saying that you passed on the spot.<br>
You should receive your license within 24 to 48 hours after registering for the exam.<br>
Your official license with call sign will arrive to you in a PDF to your email from the FCC so you can print it out to put in your wallet or frame on 
your wall. It will also have online payment instructions.<br>
Submit your $35 fee payment online to the FCC.<br>
Actually, you don’t even have to wait for your license to arrive to start transmitting – you can begin as soon as your name appears in the FCC database! 
(Typically, within 24 hours following completion of the fee payment.)<br>
Then you can begin practicing for disasters, or just chat with other amateurs and explore your new hobby.</p>
