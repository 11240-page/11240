<p class="p" align="left">&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt is now easier than ever to get your 
Amateur Radio License. When I first went to get my license, there were five 
different classes of licenses:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="p" align="left">Novice</li></p>
<li><p class="p" align="left">Technician</li></p>
<li><p class="p" align="left">General</li></p>
<li><p class="p" align="left">Advanced</li></p>
<li><p class="p" align="left">Amateur Extra</li></p>
</ul>
<p class="p" align="left">&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe novice required you pass a Morse code 
copy test of 5 WPM (words per minute) as well as the written test. Then you had 
privileges to work a small portion of some of the HF bands in the CW only portion 
of the band. Then if you passed the written Technician test, you gained some voice 
privileges on the some of the VHF and UHF bands. Next it's time to move on to 
General. You needed to up CW copy to 13 WPM and another written test. Now you got 
a larger portion of the HF bands and voice on some them. You also got a larger 
portion of the VHF and UHF bands. Now to advance to Advanced class; just a written 
test. With it you get more bands and greater portions of the bands. The Amateur 
Extra is the highest you can go. You do have to upgrade the code test to 20 WPM. 
You get full use of all the available bands.</p>
<p class="p" align="left">&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNow a days there is no more code test. 
There are only three classes that just have written tests: Technician, General, 
and Extra. You are given the entire question pools and the answers for the multiple 
choice questions to study. Can't get any easier than that.</p>
<p class="p" align="left">&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNow that we are done with the history 
lesson; let's get on with learning to pass the exam.</p>

With the test being like it is, to my understanding most schools only teach you 
to pass the test nowadays. So you don't really need to know basic electronics, 
but it can't hurt to know some. So I made up this page that has some of the 
basics.</p>

<ul>
<li><p class="p" align="left"><a href="Electrical and Electronic Basics.html" target="new">
     Electrical and Electronic Basics</a></li></p>
</ul>

<p class="p" align="left">&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI made up these html pages of the Question 
Pools for my use offline. I mostly didn't have Internet except on my phone. Trying 
to study them on my phone really sucks. And I really dislike pdfs. With html I can 
have links to jump around instead of trying to scroll thru 90 pages to get to the 
images the question may be referring to like you need to do with a pdf. So here are 
the pages I made:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="p" align="left"><a href="Technician Class Question Pool and Syllabus 2022-2026.html" target="new">
     Technician Class Question Pool and Syllabus 2022-2026</a></li></p>
<li><p class="p" align="left"><a href="General Class Question Pool and Syllabus 2023-2027.html" target="new">
     General Class Question Pool and Syllabus 2023-2027</a></li></p>
<li><p class="p" align="left"><a href="Extra Class Question Pool and Syllabus 2024-2028.html" target="new">
     Extra Class Question Pool and Syllabus 2024-2028</a></li></p>
</ul>

<p class="p" align="left">&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNow that I have internet, I found this 
site that seems really good. It's free. It states that if you register with it, 
it will track your progress and help with the areas you are having trouble with. 
It also has practice test for you to take. The second one, my daughter pointed out 
to me. It seems good too.</p>

<p class="p" align="left">After the test. The volunteers examiners will give you an 
official signed paper saying that you passed on the spot. You should receive your 
license within 24 to 48 hours after registering for the exam. Your official license 
with call sign will arrive to you in a PDF to your email from the FCC so you can 
print it out to put in your wallet or frame on your wall. It will also have online 
payment instructions.</p>
<p class="p" align="left">Submit your $35 fee payment online to the FCC.<br>
Actually, you don’t even have to wait for your license to arrive to start transmitting – 
you can begin as soon as your name appears in the FCC database! 
(Typically, within 24 hours following completion of the fee payment.) Then you can begin 
practicing for disasters, or just chat with other amateurs and explore your new hobby.</p>
