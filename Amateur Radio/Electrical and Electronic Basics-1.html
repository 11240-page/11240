Example: <font color="red">XXXX</font> is the value you are expressing such as Volts, Amperes, Ohms, Watts, etc. One kilo<font color="red">volt</font> 
would be<br>1,000 volts, one mega<font color="red">ohms</font> would be 1,000,000 ohms , one milli<font color="red">volt</font> would be 0.001 volts.

<font size="+3"><b>Voltage, Resistance and Current Flow:</b></font><br>
Everything we use in our amateur station requires a power source that delivers a specific <b>Voltage</b> and <b>Current</b><br>
capability. <b><i>Voltage</i></b> is commonly referred to as <b><i>Electro Motive Force (EMF)</i></b> instead of volts. This is like the water<br>
pressure at the bottom of a dam. The higher the water in the dam, the more pressure at the bottom of the dam.<br>
Current, the flow of electricity, is measured in <b><i>amperes</i></b> and is commonly represented by the letter <b>I</b>. This is like the<br>
flow of water in a pipe at the bottom of the dam. The amount of water flowing would be limited by the diameter<br>
of the pipe and the pressure exerted by the height of the water in the dam. In an electronic circuit the current flow<br>
would be limited by the <b>EMF <i>(voltage)</i></b> and the <b>resistance</b> to current flow measured in ohms.<br>
<img src="Electrical and Electronic Basics images/Voltage, Resistance and Current Flow.png" width="80%">
<br>
If we know the voltage and the resistance in a circuit, we can calculate the current that would be flowing using<br>
Ohms Law :<br>
<i><font color="blue">&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCurrent in amperes (I) is equal to the EMF in volts (E) divided by the resistance in ohms (R).</font></i><br>

This Triangle can help you solve for Current, Voltage and Resistance in a circuit. For example: if you have a 12-volt<br>
battery connected across a 6-ohm resistor the current flowing would be 2 amperes. You can determine this by<br>
covering the value with your thumb to see what you need to do. Cover the I and you will see that it is E (Voltage)<br>
divided by R (Resistance) therefore:<br>

Power is work done by electricity and is defined as the voltage across a circuit multiplied by the current flowing through<br> 
the circuit.<br>

This Triangle can help you solve for Power(in watts) if Voltage and voltage and Current are known. You can<br>
determine by covering the P with your thumb to see it is equal to the current (I) times the voltage (V) . Here are a<br>

<font size="+3"><b>Current Sources:</b></font><br>
In the electronic world we have two kinds of commonly encountered sources of electric power:<br>
<br>
<font size="+3"><b>Direct Current:</b></font><br>
Direct Current (DC) is a voltage that has two terminals, one positive and one negative. Typically, DC power is<br>
available from batteries, accessory jacks in vehicles, and plug-in power supplies<br>
<br>
Some commonly used batteries for amateur radio applications include the following:
<ul><li> Alkaline and Zinc Carbon cells that produce 1.5 V - available in AAA, AA, C and D cells. <font color="red"><u>These<br>

<font size="+3"><b>Alternating Current</b></font><br>

Alternating current is a voltage that alternates between equal positive and negative values. This is what is available<br>
from the 120 VAC wall outlet in your home.<br>
<br>
The 120 Volts we normally associate with the outlets in our home is the equivalent of a DC value that would provide<br>
 the same heating effect (or work) as a 120-volt DC voltage. This is known as the RMS value of the AC voltage. The <br>
heating effect of AC is less than the peak value because the voltage is continuously changing over the time for each<br>
 cycle. The peak value of an AC voltage is 1.414 times the RMS value. Therefore the peak voltage for a 120 Volt RMS<br>
 coming from the outlet in our homes would be 1.414 times 120 volts or 169.68 volts Peak or 339.36 volts peak to<br>
 peak (measured from the positive peak to the negative peak).<br>
<table width="100%"><tr><td width="1%">&nbsp</td><td width="99% align="left">
<img src="Electrical and Electronic Basics images/AC Voltage.png" width="86%">
</td></tr></table><br>
For a pure sine wave the equivalent RMS value is 0.707 times the peak value. Conversely the peak voltage can be<br>
 calculated as 1.414 times the RMS Value.<br>
<br>
<font size="+3"><b>Examples:</b></font><br>
The peak voltage present in standard 120V RMS AC line voltage is 1.414 x 120V or approx. 170 volts peak. The peak<br>
 to peak (maximum negative to maximum positive peaks) would be two times the peak voltage or approx. 340 V Peak<br>

<br>
An AC voltage that reads 65 volts on an RMS meter will have a peak to peak voltage of 184 Volts.<br>

<i><font color="blue">Peak to peak Voltage = 2 x RMS x 1.414 <font color="red">or</font> PP = 2 x 65 x 1.414 <font color="red">or</font>

<br>
<font size="+3"><b>FREQUENCY:</b></font><br>
If we start at the first positive peak to the next positive peak of one cycle of our sine wave you will observe that it<br>
crosses through Zero twice in the cycle.<br>
The time it takes for one cycle of a sine wave is the period of the sine wave. A 100 Hz sine wave has a period of .01<br>
Seconds (or 10 milliseconds).<br>
<br>
Frequency is the number of times that an event happens in one second of time. Shown below is a single cycle of a<br>
sine wave, as it would be displayed on an oscilloscope. To determine its frequency, you would divide the time in<br>
seconds for one cycle into 1.00.<br>

</font></i></td></tr></table><br>
<font size="+3"><b>Wavelength:</b></font><br>
Wavelength is the physical distance a wave will travel during one cycle usually expressed in meters. Radio waves in<br>
free space travel at the speed of light. Light travels at a speed of approximately 300 million meters per second<br>
<i><font color="blue">(actual speed of light is 299,792,458 meters every second in free space)</font></i> in free space. Wavelength is important in<br>
amateur radio when designing and building antennas.<br>
<table width="100%"><tr><td width="7%">&nbsp</td><td width="93% align="left">
<img src="Electrical and Electronic Basics images/wavelength.png" width="54%">
</td></tr></table>
We frequently refer to the frequency bands in amateur radio by their wavelength in meters. For instance, 146<br>
Megahertz (MHz) would be the 2-meter band. Wavelength is easily calculated as using the following equation:<br>
	Wavelength equals the speed of light (in meters per second) divided by the frequency<br>
		Wavelength = 300,000,000 ÷ frequency; or to simplify,<br>
		Wavelength = 300 ÷ Frequency (in megahertz)<br>
<br>
For the 146 MHz example above this would be:<br>
<i><font color="blue">300,000,000 divided by 146,000,000;</font></i> or since both values are in millions simply,<br>
<table width="100%"><tr><td width="5%">&nbsp</td><td width="95% align="left">
<i><font color="blue">300 ÷ 146 or 2.054 meters</font></i></td></tr></table><br>
This is an important relationship to remember since there are questions in the exam relating to wavelength for a<br>
specific frequency or the frequency for a given wavelength.<br>
2022<br>
<br>
In amateur radio we frequently refer to our frequencies in terms of approximate wavelength. Since we frequently <br>
operating in the Megahertz frequency range, we can simplify our conversion to wavelength by dividing the frequency <br>
in megahertz (MHz) into 300. For example:<br>
<table width="100%"><tr><td width="5%">&nbsp</td><td width="95% align="left">
<i><font color="blue">A 146 MHz signal would be in the 2 meter band --- 300 ÷ 146 = 2.054-meters</font></i></d></tr>
<tr><td width="5%">&nbsp</td><td width="95% align="left">
<i><font color="blue">A 4.0 MHz signal would be in the 75 meter band --- 300 ÷ 4 = 75-meters
</font></i></td></tr></table><br>

<font size="+3"><b>RF Signals and Modulation</b></font><br>
Radio frequencies are simply sine waves like we see coming out of the outlet at home except at a much higher<br>
Repetition rate (frequency) Radio signals in the AM Broadcast band are operating from 500,000 hertz to 1,700,000<br>
Hertz. This frequency range can be expressed in kilohertz (thousands of hertz as 500 KHz to 1,700 KHz), or in<br>
megahertz (millions of hertz) as 0.500 MHz to 1.700 MHz<br>
<br>
The frequency of a signal is just the carrier frequency, that is the frequency with no information applied. When we<br>
add voice or data to the carrier we are “modulating” or adding information. Simple modulation can be accomplished<br>
by varying the frequency of the carrier (Frequency Modulation or FM) or varying the amplitude of the carrier<br>
amplitude (Amplitude Modulation or AM).<br>
